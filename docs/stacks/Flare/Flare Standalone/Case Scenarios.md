In this scenario, our input data source is read from the local system, processed locally on Standalone, and written locally. If you'd like to know more, you can go ahead and refer to
[Local to Local using Standalone 2.0 ](Case%20Scenarios/Local%20to%20Local%20using%20Standalone%202%200.md).

## **Read from Cloud, Write to the Local**

In this case scenario, our data source is read from the cloud, which is then processed locally on Standalone and written to the local. The Cloud could be any data source that Standalone supports whose configurations are given in the Standalone YAML configurations. If you'd like to know more, you can go ahead and refer to
[Cloud to Local - Using Standalone 2.0](Case%20Scenarios/Cloud%20to%20Local%20-%20Using%20Standalone%202%200.md).

Standalone 1.0 can read/write datasets locally. It has two operating modes: via Docker or DataOS CLI. If you'd like to know more about these two routes to transform your data locally, you can refer to:

- [Local to Local - Using Docker](Case%20Scenarios/Local%20to%20Local%20-%20Using%20Docker.md)

- [Local to Local - Using DataOS CLI](Case%20Scenarios/Local%20to%20Local%20-%20Using%20DataOS%20CLI.md)
