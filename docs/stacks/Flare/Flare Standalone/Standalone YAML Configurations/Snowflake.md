**Input Section Configuration for Reading from Snowflake Data Source**

```yaml
inputs:
  - name: city_connect
    inputType: snowflake
    snowflake:
      url: <snowflake-host-address>
      database: <database> # make sure database exist
      table: <table/dataset>
      schema: <schema/collection> # make sure schema exist
      snowflakeWarehouse: <warehousename> # make sure warehouse is running
				# in Snowflake otherwise your job will fail to submit the query
      user: <username>
      password: <password>
```


> üó£Ô∏è You can provide either `token`, `pemPrivateKey`, or `password` to access data from snowflake.
