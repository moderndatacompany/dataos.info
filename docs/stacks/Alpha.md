# **Alpha**

DataOS provides various stacks to accomplish different kinds of functionality. For querying, you have **Minerva** - SQL query engine, **Surge** for Complex Event Processing, and **Benthos** for mundane stream workloads. You can use **Flare**, a Spark-backed data-processing engine, to create complex workflows to carry out the data processing tasks.

DataOS gives you a convenient way to use Alpha stack to add ad-hoc functionalities on top of DataOS. You can develop your application and create an image of it. This image can be exposed to DataOS using the Alpha stack.

All the functionality and logic are written in your application, and then this logic is executed within DataOS using Alpha stack.

You can add ingress and autoscaling capabilities to your application. You can also make it part of a workflow.

## **Requirements**

You need to:

1. Package your application into a Docker image. To learn more about building Docker images for your Apps, refer to [Containerize an application](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/02_our_app/).
2. Push container image to Docker Hub to share the created image. To learn more about pushing images to Docker Hub, refer to [Manage repositories](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/repos/#:~:text=To%20push%20an%20image%20to,docs%2Fbase%3Atesting%20).

## **Deploy Application**

The following steps describe how to deploy an application as a service using the DataOS Alpha stack.

1. [Create a service using Alpha stack](Alpha.md)

2. [Define the policy for your application](Alpha.md)

## **Create a Service**

Provide the following configuration properties:

- **Replicas**: Create multiple replicated services.
- **Autoscaling**: Manage autoscaling to match changing application workload levels.

    ```yaml
    autoScaling:
        enabled: true
        minReplicas: 2
        maxReplicas: 4
        targetMemoryUtilizationPercentage: 80
        targetCPUUtilizationPercentage: 80
    ```

- **Ingress**: Configure the incoming port for the service to allow access to DataOS resources from external links. Provide the following properties.
    - Enable ingress port.
    - Provide a path that will be part of the public URL to access the service outside DataOS.
    - Enable the strip path to strip the specified path and forward the request to the upstream service.
    - Set `noAuthentication` to false if authentication is needed.

    ```yaml
    ingress:
        enabled: true
        noAuthentication: true
        path: <path>                  
        stripPath: true
    ```

- **Image**: Latest application docker image.

    ```yaml
    stack: alpha
        alpha:
          image: <docker-image>
    ```

- **Arguments**: to pass arguments to the application.

  Here is the complete example YAML for a Swagger UI that enables users to try out the API calls directly in the browser.

    ```yaml
    version: v1beta1
    name: swaggerui
    type: service

    service:
      title: Swagger UI
      replicas: 1
      servicePort: 8080

      ingress:                                # configure ingress
        enabled: true
        noAuthentication: true
        path: /swagger-ui                     # 
        stripPath: true

      envs:
        LOG_LEVEL: info

      stack: alpha
      alpha:
        image: swaggerapi/swagger-ui           # docker image
    ```

## **Define a Policy**

Allow users to perform a specific set of operations using the application.

```yaml
name: "swagger-ui"
version: v1beta1
type: policy
layer: system
description: "Allow user to access swagger-ui static files"
policy:
  access:
    subjects:
      tags:
        - - "dataos:u:user"                 
    predicates:             
      - "GET"
      - "POST"
      - "OPTIONS"
    objects:
      paths:
        - "/swagger-ui"
    allow: true
```

The following example shows how to define the arguments passed for the multiple commands to be executed by the data tool.

```yaml
version: v1beta1
name: dataos-tool-add-prop
type: workflow
workflow:
  dag:
   - name: dataos-tool-add-prop
  spec:
  envs:
    LOG_LEVEL: debug
  stack: alpha
  alpha:
    image: <docker-image>
    arguments:
      - dataset
      - add-properties
         - --address
         - dataos://icebase:retail/city_pulsar_01
         - --property
         - write.metadata.previous-versions-max:3
```
