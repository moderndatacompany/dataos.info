# Scanner Workflow Related Errors

When you run a Scanner workflow, you may see errors that can affect the metadata scan. Here is a list of commonly encountered errors and their solutions.

## Error #1

Sometimes a user might get an ERROR 403 (Example Below) while running the Scanner Jobs.

### Suggested Solution

To overcome this issue, we need to run the job as Metis user  `runAsUser: metis`

The following YAML displays the section where you need to add this information.

```yaml
version: v1
name: wf-bigquery-depot
type: workflow
tags:
  - bigquery-depot
description: The job scans schema tables and register data
workflow:
  dag:
    - name: bigquery-depot
      description: The job scans schema from bigquery-depot tables and register data to metis2
      spec:
        tags:
          - scanner
        stack: scanner:2.0
        compute: runnable-default
        runAsUser: metis                #run as Metis user
        scanner:
          depot: demoprepbq
          
```

## Error #2

While scanning PostgreSQL database metadata, If the user doesn't have login access for the underlying database, this error will be shown.

```bash

psycopg2.OperationalError: connection to server at "mebash.postgres.database.azure.com" (20.81.106.165), port 5432 failed: FATAL:  password authentication failed for user "ashish"
connection to server at "mebash.postgres.database.azure.com" (20.81.106.165), port 5432 failed: FATAL:  no pg_hba.conf entry for host "20.219.178.198", user "ashish", database "postgres", no encryption
```

### Suggested Solution

The user needs to have both `CONNECT` and `SELECT`  privileges on the database.

To check privileges:

```sql
SELECT table_catalog, table_schema, table_name, privilege_type
FROM   information_schema.table_privileges 
WHERE  grantee = 'MY_USER_Name'
```

## Error #3

If the user doesn't have access to the Database, then such an error will be thrown.

```bash
psycopg2.OperationalError: connection to server at "mebash.postgres.database.azure.com" (20.81.106.165), port 5432 failed: FATAL:  permission denied for database "ashish_access"
DETAIL:  User does not have CONNECT privilege.
```

### Suggested Solution

The user needs to have both `CONNECT` and `SELECT`  privileges on the database.

To check Privileges:

```sql
SELECT table_catalog, table_schema, table_name, privilege_type
FROM   information_schema.table_privileges 
WHERE  grantee = 'MY_USER_Name'
```

> ðŸ—£ The errors thrown in the case of Redshift and PostgresSQL databases are mostly the same. Please check if you have enough permissions to scan the metadata from the underlying sources.

## Error #4

You may get the following error for value is not a valid enumeration member or extra fields not permitted.

### Suggested Solution

Check the `scanner` section of your YAML file. You have mistyped the property name or mentioned a property that does not exist. For example, if you enter `service` for the property `source`, you will get this error. Similarly, if you type depo instead of  `depot`, your Scanner workflow will not run and throw this error.

## Error #5

In case of Snowflake, you may get the following error while scanning data for warehouse is not configured for this depot.

### Suggested Solution

You encounter the above error when Snowflake depot is configured with a database name instead of a warehouse name. Please contact the DataOS administrator to fix this with the depot. You need the warehouse name in the Depot configuration YAML file for scanning metadata.

## Error #6

You will encounter this error when you try to scan unstructured data stored in File/blob storage.
