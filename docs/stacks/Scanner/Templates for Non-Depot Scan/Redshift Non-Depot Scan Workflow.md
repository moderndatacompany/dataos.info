# **Redshift Non-Depot Scan Workflow**

The non-depot Scanner workflow will help you to connect with Redshift to extract metadata details such as schemas, tables, view details etc.

# **Requirements**

1. Credentials to connect to Redshift database.
2. `SVV_TABLE_INFO` View contains summary information for tables in the Redshift database and is visible only to superusers. You need permissions to query the view while scanning metadata from Scanner workflow.
3. Redshift user must grantÂ `SELECT`privilege on tableÂ [SVV_TABLE_INFO](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/r_SVV_TABLE_INFO.html) to fetch the metadata of tables and views.

# **Scanner Workflow**

Here is an example of YAML configuration to connect to the source and reach the Metis server to save the metadata in Metis DB.

1. Create and apply the Scanner YAML. You need to provide source connection details and configuration settings such as  metadata type and filter patterns to include/exclude assets for metadata scanning.
    
    ```yaml
    version: v1
    name: redshift-nd-scanner2
    type: workflow
    tags:
      - redshift-scanner

    workflow:
      dag:
        - name: redshift-scanner2

            scanner:

              source: RedshiftSource_ND
              sourceConnection:
                config:
                  type: Redshift

                  # If we want to iterate over all databases, set it to true
                  # ingestAllDatabases: true
              sourceConfig:
                config:
                  markDeletedTables: false
                  includeTables: true
                  includeViews: true
                  # includeTags: true
                  # databaseFilterPattern:
                  #   includes:
                  #     - database1
                  #     - database2
                  #   excludes:
                  #     - database3
                  #     - database4
                  schemaFilterPattern:
                    includes:
                      - Public
                  #     - schema2
                  #   excludes:
                  #     - schema3
                  #     - schema4
                  # tableFilterPattern:
                  #   includes:
                  #     - table1
                  #     - table2
                  #   excludes:
                  #     - table3
                  #     - table4
    ```
    
      > **Note:** Remove the commented part mentioned under the filter pattern in the Scanner YAML to apply filters for the required schemas and tables.
      
     
     
    1. After the successful workflow run, you can check the metadata of scanned Tables on Metis UI.
        
        
        > ðŸ—£ Filtering for the Scanner workflow works on a hierarchy level; First, it will filter all given schemas and then the table in that schema if present.
