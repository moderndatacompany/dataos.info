# **CLI**

We believe in API first, CLI second and UI third. DataOS design exemplifies this belief system. Don‚Äôt take our word for it, check out our CLI to see for yourself. Through CLI, you can access, use and marvel at the full capabilities of DataOS.

CLI is where your journey starts if you wear any of these hats: that of a Data Engineer or Analytical Engineer, IT services for your enterprise, Infosec division or DevOps. With that in mind, let‚Äôs get you started on our command terminal. It will only take a couple of minutes.

## **Installation**

Before you test your mettle on our CLI, let‚Äôs make sure you have what it takes.

### **Requirements**

 1.  Please ensure that the curl utility is installed on your system. To check, use this command:

        ```bash
        curl --version
        ```

        If curl is not installed, follow the steps [here](CLI.md).

2. Get the following items from our Customer Success team:
    - DataOS prime apikey
    - The domain name of the DataOS context/instance
2. Find out the operating system you are using, then follow the installation steps for the OS on your computer - perhaps the most obvious thing in the world!

### **MacOS**

1. Export the environment variable PRIME_APIKEY to pass it to the next commands.

    ```bash
    export PRIME_APIKEY="<DataOS¬Æ prime apikey>"

    #<DataOS¬Æ prime apikey> should be replaced by the API key to connect with the prime context
    ```

1. Download the checksum file using the following command (input the OS architecture value of your system and the CLI version you want to install):

    ```jsx
    curl --silent --output dataos-ctl-<OS_ARCH>.tar.gz.sha256sum --location --request GET "https://prime.tmdata.io/plutus/api/v1/files/download?name=dataos-ctl-<OS_ARCH>.tar.gz.sha256sum&dir=cli-apps-<CLI_VERSION>&apikey=$PRIME_APIKEY"

    #For example, a mac user with an intel chip will input the below command
    #curl --silent --output dataos-ctl-darwin-amd64.tar.gz.sha256sum --location --request GET "https://prime.tmdata.io/plutus/api/v1/files/download?name=dataos-ctl-darwin-amd64.tar.gz.sha256sum&dir=cli-apps-2.5&apikey=$PRIME_APIKEY"

    #2.5 is the CLI version getting installed
    #darwin-amd64 is the processor
    #Contact the admin(operator in your organisation) to get the latest version of the CLI
    ```

1. Download the DataOS CLI binary using the below command (input the OS architecture value of your system and the CLI version you want to install)

    ```jsx

    curl --silent --output dataos-ctl-<OS_ARCH>.tar.gz --location --request GET "https://prime.tmdata.io/plutus/api/v1/files/download?name=dataos-ctl-<OS_ARCH>.tar.gz&dir=cli-apps-<CLI_VERSION>&apikey=$PRIME_APIKEY"

    #For example, a mac user with intel-chip will input the below command
    #curl --silent --output dataos-ctl-darwin-amd64.tar.gz --location --request GET "https://prime.tmdata.io/plutus/api/v1/files/download?name=dataos-ctl-darwin-amd64.tar.gz&dir=cli-apps-2.5&apikey=$PRIME_APIKEY"

    #Contact the admin(operator in your organisation) to get the latest version of the CLI
    ```

1. Validate that the zip has not been tampered with (this is an optional step).

    ```jsx
    shasum -a 256 -c dataos-ctl-<OS_Arch>.tar.gz.sha256sum

    #shasum -a 256 -c dataos-ctl-darwin-amd64.tar.gz.sha256sum
    ```

    If everything is well & good, you should get the following output:

    ```bash
    dataos-ctl-darwin-amd64.tar.gz: OK
    ```

1. Extract the dataos-ctl binary.

    ```bash
    tar -xvf dataos-ctl-<OS_Arch>.tar.gz

    #example: tar -xvf dataos-ctl-darwin-amd64.tar.gz
    ```

    If done right, this will be the output:

    ```bash
    x darwin-amd64/
    x darwin-amd64/dataos-ctl
    ```

    > üó£Ô∏è Place the extracted dataos-ctl in a directory that is in your PATH. In MacOS, you can achieve this using the following command:

    ```jsx
    export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.dataos/bin
    ```

    > üìå  To access DataOS, you have to run this command every time you restart your computer‚Äôs terminal or open a new tab in the terminal. If you are too lazy to do that, you should add the above path in your .zshrc file
    > 
    > - To add the path to you .zshrc file, you can follow the steps given in this toggle list. Click the toggle icon.
    >     
    >     ```bash
    >     #make sure you are in your home directory "~/ (home/<user>)"
    >     #create .zshrc file using the command below
    >     touch .zshrc
    >     
    >     #open the file using the command below
    >     ~/.zshrc
    >     
    >     #simply copy & paste the path to your .zshrc file
    >     export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.dataos/bin
    >     
    >     #close the .zshrc file window and load the file in the shell using
    >     source ~/.zshrc
    >     ```
    >     

Yay! You have successfully installed the CLI, now let‚Äôs initialize. 

### **Linux**

1. Export the environment variable PRIME_APIKEY to pass it to the subsequent commands.

    ```bash
    export PRIME_APIKEY=<DataOS¬Æ prime apikey>
    ```

1. Determine processor architecture.

    ```bash
    uname -p
    ```

    You will get the following output based on your processor.

    ```bash
    amd64 
    #sample example
    #if the output here comes as x86_64, it also means you have amd64 processor
    ```

1. Update the <ARCH> value & <CLI_version> in the following command to download the checksum file. The available ARCH values are 386, amd64, arm, arm64.

    ```bash
    curl --silent --output dataos-ctl-linux-<ARCH>.tar.gz.sha256sum --location --request GET "https://prime.tmdata.io/plutus/api/v1/files/download?name=dataos-ctl-linux-<ARCH>.tar.gz.sha256sum&dir=cli-apps-<CLI_VERSION>&apikey=$PRIME_APIKEY"

    #2.5 is the CLI version getting installed
    #Contact the admin(operator in your organisation) to get the latest version
    #example: curl --silent --output dataos-ctl-linux-amd64.tar.gz.sha256sum --location --request GET "https://prime.tmdata.io/plutus/api/v1/files/download?name=dataos-ctl-linux-amd64.tar.gz.sha256sum&dir=cli-apps-2.5&apikey=$PRIME_APIKEY"
    ```

1. Download the CLI binary file using the following command

    ```bash
    curl --silent --output dataos-ctl-linux-<ARCH>.tar.gz --location --request GET "https://prime.tmdata.io/plutus/api/v1/files/download?name=dataos-ctl-linux-<ARCH>.tar.gz&dir=cli-apps-<CLI_version>&apikey=$PRIME_APIKEY"
    #replace the <ARCH> & <CLI_version> before executing the command
    ```

1. Validate that the zip has not been tampered (optional step).

    ```jsx
    #update the <ARCH> value in the command

    shasum -a 256 -c dataos-ctl-linux-<ARCH>.tar.gz.sha256sum
    ```

    Expected output after running the above command:

    ```bash
    dataos-ctl-linux-<ARCH>.tar.gz: OK
    ```

6. Extract the dataos-ctl binary.

    ```jsx
    #update the <ARCH> value in the command

    tar -xvf dataos-ctl-linux-<ARCH>.tar.gz
    ```

    Expected output:

    ```bash
    x linux-<ARCH>/
    x linux-<ARCH>/dataos-ctl
    ```

    > üó£Ô∏è Place the extracted dataos-ctl in a directory that is in your PATH. In Linux, you can achieve this using the following command:

    ```jsx
    export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.dataos/bin
    ```

    > üìå  To access DataOS, you have to run this command every time you restart your computer‚Äôs terminal or open a new tab in the terminal. If you are too lazy to do that, you should add the above path in your .bashrc file
    > 
    > - To add the path to you .bashrc file, you can follow the steps given in this toggle list. Click the toggle icon.

    >     #create .bashrc file using the command below
    >     touch .bashrc
    >     
    >     #open the file using the command below
    >     xdg-open ~/.bashrc
    >     
    >     #simply copy & paste the path at the end of your .bashrc file
    >     export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.dataos/bin
    >     
    >     #save and close the .bashrc file window and load the file in the shell using the command
    >     source ~/.bashrc
    >     ```
    >     

Yay! You have successfully installed the CLI, now let‚Äôs initialize. 

### **Windows**

1. Check whether your system has an **Intel 64bit chip** or an **AMD chip.**
2. Download the CLI binary by typing the given links in your web browser **(according to the chip type AMD/Intel 64bit)**
    - **For intel 64bit chip, follow these steps:**
    1. The below link will help you download the shasum file. In the link given below, 386 is the OS Architecture(processor) of your system and 2.4 is the CLI version.
        
        https://prime.tmdata.io/plutus/api/v1/files/download?name=dataos-ctl-windows-386.tar.gz.sha256sum&dir=cli-apps-2.4&apikey=$PRIME_APIKEY
    
    1. The below link will help you download .tar file.
        
        https://prime.tmdata.io/plutus/api/v1/files/download?name=dataos-ctl-windows-386.tar.gz&dir=cli-apps-2.4&apikey=$PRIME_APIKEY
    
    
    - **For AMD chip, follow these steps:**
    1. The below link will help you download shasum file. In the link given below, amd64 is the OS Architecture(processor) of your system and 2.4 is the CLI version
        
        https://prime.tmdata.io/plutus/api/v1/files/download?name=dataos-ctl-windows-amd64.tar.gz.sha256sum&dir=cli-apps-2.4&apikey=$PRIME_APIKEY
        
    1. The below link will help you download .tar file.
        
        https://prime.tmdata.io/plutus/api/v1/files/download?name=dataos-ctl-windows-amd64.tar.gz&dir=cli-apps-2.4&apikey=$PRIME_APIKEY
        
    
3. The next step is to unzip the downloaded .tar file, to extract it, you will need an archiver utility like Winrar. 
2. Open Winrar and highlight the zipped tar file (it should appear with other downloaded files in the lower part of the page), and click the **‚ÄúExtract to‚Äù** button on the top. Place it in your chosen directory. 

> üó£Ô∏è You will always use this directory to run DataOS. To open the DataOS from anywhere in the system, place the extracted file in a directory that is in your **PATH**. To add the directory in **PATH**, refer to [Setting the Path and Variables in Windows](CLI/Setting%20the%20Path%20and%20Variables%20in%20Windows.md).

Yay! You have successfully installed the CLI, now let‚Äôs initialize. 

## **Initialize**

If you have reached here, you are nearly there - at the promised landscape of DataOS. To initialize, run the init command.

```bash
dataos-ctl init
```

This command will start a short(really short) Q&A session. Don‚Äôt worry, I have got the cheat sheet below. Just follow the instructions.

```bash
dataos-ctl init

#to keep things interesting, the 'Y' is capital lettered, while 'n' is small lettered

INFO[0000] The DataOS¬Æ is already initialized, do you want to add a new context? (Y,n)  
->Y   #input the answer: Y or n
INFO[0255] üöÄ initialization...
                        
INFO[0255] The DataOS¬Æ is not initialized, do you want to proceed with initialization? (Y,n)  
->Y

INFO[0269] Please enter a name for the current DataOS¬Æ Context?  
-><name of the DataOS context> 
#for example 'kutumbakam'. You can write the name of your choice.
#your enterprise can have multiple contexts available for you to connect. Choose any one.
#you can always change the context through a CLI command, after login. 

INFO[0383] Please enter the fully qualified domain name of the DataOS¬Æ instance?  
-><domain name> 
#for example 'vasudhaiva-kutumbakam.dataos.app'
INFO[0408] entered DataOS¬Æ: kutumbakam : vasudhaiva-kutumbakam.dataos.app 

INFO[0408] Are you operating the DataOS¬Æ? (Y,n)         
->n  
#if you are the operator(admin) for your enterprise, type Y
#the installation steps, if you type Y, will change.
INFO[0452] üöÄ initialization...complete
```

If you are the operator/admin for your enterprise then the installation steps for you, after the last step, will change. These are covered in the Operator Document for DataOS.

## **Log in**

After the successful initialization of DataOS context, you can log into your account with the following command. Finally, the moment we have been waiting for is here.

```jsx
dataos-ctl login
```

If your enterprise has taken multiple DataOS contexts then you can use the same command terminal client, the one you just installed, to access & use any of those contexts.

## **Test**

Run the following commands to ensure the successful installation of DataOS CLI. These commands will show the version and health status of the installed DataOS CLI.

```jsx
dataos-ctl version
dataos-ctl health
```

Did it take you more than a couple of minutes? Well, when someone says ‚Äòjust a minute‚Äô they don‚Äôt mean it literally!
