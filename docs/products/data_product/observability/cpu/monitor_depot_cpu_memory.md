# Monitor the CPU and Memory Usage of a Depot

<aside class="callout">
ðŸ—£ Only Depots created on Object Storage will have available CPU and memory usage data.
</aside>

When an object storage Depot Resource is created, a corresponding pod is automatically provisioned in the backend. Users can monitor the CPU and memory usage of this pod directly through the Metis Catalog, Operations app, or Grafana.

<aside class="callout">
ðŸ—£ If a pod exceeds its defined CPU or memory limit, the container may be throttled (in case of CPU) or OOMKilled (Out of Memory Killed) by the Kubernetes scheduler. This results in job failure and possible downstream disruptions. To avoid unintended job termination, especially for critical workload, it's recommended to omit hard limits when the exact resource requirements are not known. Doing so allows the container to exceed default boundaries if spare capacity exists in the cluster.

    </div>
    
    This graph illustrates the CPU usage trend (in millicores) for the pod `thirdparty-ss-0` over a continuous time range.
    
    - **Blue Line (Usage)**: Represents the actual CPU consumption by the pod. The values remain consistently below the green request line, indicating efficient and stable CPU usage without any spikes.
    - **Green Line (Request)**: Reflects the guaranteed minimum CPU resources allocated to the pod. This pod is guaranteed around 120 millicores, which it never exceeds based on the usage data.
    - **Yellow Line (Limit)**: Shows the maximum CPU limit assigned to the pod, set at 1000 millicores. The pod is permitted to use up to this threshold if needed, but the actual usage remains far below this cap.
    
    The pod is running well within its allocated CPU boundaries. The significant gap between usage and request/limit suggests low CPU load. This may indicate an underutilized workload. No scaling or throttling concerns are present.
    
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <img src="/products/data_product/observability/cpu/depot/depot_time_series_1000_usage_request.png" style="border:1px solid black; width: 70%; height: auto">
      <figcaption><i>Pod memory usage vs request and limit</i></figcaption>
    </div>
    
    This graph shows the memory usage pattern (in mebibytes) for the pod over time, helping to evaluate how efficiently memory resources are utilized.
    
    - **Blue Line (Usage)**: Indicates the actual memory being used by the pod, which remains stable around 330 MiB. This steady usage suggests consistent and predictable memory demands.
    - **Green Line (Request)**: Represents the guaranteed minimum memory allocated to the pod, set at 640 MiB. The actual usage stays well within this threshold, ensuring no risk of eviction or throttling due to memory pressure.
    - **Yellow Line (Limit)**: Denotes the upper cap of memory the pod is allowed to consume, set at 1500 MiB. This provides headroom for unexpected memory spikes, but no such behavior is observed here.
    
    The podâ€™s memory consumption is well within both its request and limit values. This indicates the workload is memory-efficient and not close to saturation. Memory resources are adequately provisioned, possibly over-allocated depending on workload criticality.
    
    <div style="text-align: center;">

    This aggregate table summarizes pod-level resource usage over 120 time slices with high stability and low variance.
    
    <aside class="callout">
    ðŸ—£ A time slice represents a fixed interval over which resource metrics (like CPU or memory usage) are sampled by monitoring tools such as Prometheus. For example, if the scrape interval is set to 15 seconds, each time slice captures the resource state during that 15-second window. These slices are then aggregated to analyze usage trends over a defined period, enabling accurate measurement and visualization of pod or container performance over time.
    </aside>
    
    **CPU Metrics (millicore):**
    
    - **Usage**: The pod consumed on average 1.02 millicores, peaking at 1.57 millicores, which is extremely low relative to its limits.
    - **Request**: The CPU request was 100 millicores, ensuring this is the baseline reserved capacity.
    - **Limit**: The pod was allowed to consume up to 1000 millicores (1 core), which it never approached.
    
    **Memory Metrics (mebibyte):**
    
    - **Usage**: Average memory usage was 357.37 MiB, staying within a narrow range, indicating stable memory behavior.
    - **Request**: The memory request was 550 MiB, comfortably above the observed usage.
    - **Limit**: A memory cap of 1500 MiB was set, offering ample buffer.
    
    This pod is operating with significant headroom. CPU utilization is consistently under 2% of the limit, and memory usage stays well within the request and limit thresholds. The uniformity across min, max, and median values reflects predictable, controlled behavior â€” ideal for critical workloads requiring resource stability.

## Grafana

When a Depot Resource is created, a corresponding pod is automatically provisioned in the back-end. You can monitor the CPU and memory usage of this pod directly through the Grafana app.

To monitor the CPU and memory usage of a Depot on the Grafana app, follow the steps below:

1. Execute the following command in DataOS CLI to get the pod name corresponding to the Depot Resource.
    
    ```bash
    dataos-ctl log -t depot -n ${{depot-name}}
    ```
    
    **Example usage:**
    
    ```bash
    dataos-ctl log -t depot -n thirdparty
    INFO[0000] ðŸ“ƒ log(public)...
