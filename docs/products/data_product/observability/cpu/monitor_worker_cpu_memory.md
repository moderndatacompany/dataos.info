    **CPU usage:**
    
    - Usage (blue line) shows actual CPU consumed by the Worker pod, increasing steadily and reaching just above 600 millicores.
    - Request (green line) is fixed at approximately 250 millicores, indicating the CPU guaranteed for the pod at scheduling time.
    - Limit (yellow line) is flat at 2000 millicores, representing the maximum CPU the pod is allowed to use if resources are available.
    
    <aside class="callout">
    üó£ The actual usage exceeds the requested value, meaning the pod consumed more than what was guaranteed but stayed well below the limit. This could result in temporary throttling, and it may be worth revisiting the request configuration for better scheduling efficiency.

      <figcaption><i>Aggregated CPU and memory statistics</i></figcaption>
    </div>
    
    **Details:**
    
    - **Type**: Indicates whether the metric refers to CPU or memory.
    - **Name**: Describes the metric subtype `usage` (actual consumption), `request` (minimum reserved), or `limit` (maximum allowed).
    - **Mean / Median / Min / Max**: Statistical summaries over the measured time slices.
    - **Sum**: Total usage across all time slices.
    - **Unit**: CPU is in millicores (1000 millicores = 1 core); memory is in mebibytes (1 MiB = 1,048,576 bytes).
    - **CPU Usage**: Average CPU usage was 460 millicores, peaking at 690 millicores. The pod used significantly more than its request, but stayed within the limit.
    - **CPU Request**: Set at 200 millicores consistently, meaning the pod was guaranteed a small baseline of CPU.
    - **CPU Limit**: Fixed at 2000 millicores (2 cores), providing ample room for the workload to scale under load.
    - **Memory Usage**: Average memory usage was approximately 527.72 MiB, with a maximum usage of 791.58 MiB.
    - **Memory Request**: Set at 2432 MiB, meaning this much memory was reserved and guaranteed to the pod.
    - **Memory Limit**: Also set at 2432 MiB, indicating that the pod could not use more memory than requested.
    
    > The Worker was allowed to consume significantly more CPU than it requested, and it did so, but stayed under the defined limit. Memory usage remained far below both the request and limit. This suggests an opportunity to reduce memory allocation to free up resources for other workloads.

    </div>
    
4. Click on the pod name for which you want to monitor the CPU and memory usage, and navigate to the ‚ÄòRuntime Node Usage‚Äô section.
    
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <img src="/products/data_product/observability/cpu/worker/worker_sales360workerju9zss0_runtime_node_details_runtime.png" style="border:1px solid black; width: 70%; height: auto">
      <figcaption><i>Runtime Node Usage details</i></figcaption>
    </div>
    
    **Details:**
    
    - **Type**: Indicates whether the metric is related to CPU or memory.
    - **Name**: Specifies the metric subtype, `usage` (actual consumption), `request` (guaranteed minimum), and `limit` (maximum allocable resource).
    - **Mean / Median / Min / Max**: Statistical summaries of the metric over the evaluated time slices.
    - **Sum**: Total value accumulated across all time slices.
    - **Unit**: Measurement unit (millicore for CPU, mebibyte for memory).
    - **CPU Usage**: Average CPU usage was ~1.86 millicores, peaking at 2 millicores (1 core = 1000 millicores). Millicores provide fine-grained control over how much CPU each pod or container should receive.
    - **CPU Request**: The pods are configured to request 100 millicores of CPU each, consistently across time slices.
    - **CPU Limit**: The pods are configured to limit 2000 millicores of CPU each, consistently across time slices.
    - **Memory Usage**: Average memory consumption stands at ~135.43 MiB, with a peak at 135.85 MiB (1 MiB = 2¬≤‚Å∞ bytes = 1,048,576 bytes).
    - **Memory Request**: Each pod has been allocated 256.00 MiB as a guaranteed memory reservation.
    - **Memory Limit**: Each pod has been allocated 2048 MiB as a limited memory reservation.

      <figcaption><i>CPU usage over time in Operations</i></figcaption>
    </div>
    
    **CPU usage:**
    
    - Usage (blue line) shows intermittent spikes in CPU consumption, peaking close to 600 millicores. Between spikes, CPU usage drops near zero, indicating short bursts of activity followed by idle periods.
    - Request (green line) is not plotted, suggesting no CPU request was explicitly configured or it‚Äôs not captured here.
    - Limit (yellow line) remains constant at around 1200 millicores, representing the maximum CPU the pod can consume.
    
    <aside class="callout">
    üó£ The CPU usage exhibits bursty behavior, likely due to periodic task execution. Since usage stays well within the limit, throttling is unlikely, but the absence of a visible request means scheduling guarantees may not be enforced.
    </aside>
    
    **Memory usage:**
    
    - Usage (blue line) steadily increases, reaching up to 1900 MiB, then dips temporarily and stabilizes again around 1200‚Äì1400 MiB. This indicates a consistent memory footprint with some momentary drops.
    - Request (green line) is missing, indicating it was either not set or not shown in this view.
    - Limit (yellow line) is fixed at 2048 MiB, defining the upper bound for memory allocation.
    
    <aside class="callout">
    üó£ Memory usage is close to the limit but stays within bounds, suggesting the pod is memory-intensive. A configured memory request would improve scheduling reliability.

## Grafana

When a Worker Resource is created, a corresponding pod is automatically provisioned in the back-end. You can monitor the CPU and memory usage of this pod directly through the Grafana app.

To monitor the CPU and memory usage of a Service on the Grafana app, follow the steps below:

1. Execute the following command in DataOS CLI to get the pod name corresponding to the Service Resource.
    
    ```bash
    dataos-ctl log -t worker -n sales360-worker -w research
    ```
    
    **Example usage:**
    
    ```bash
    dataos-ctl log -t worker -w research -n sales360-worker 
    INFO[0000] üìÉ log(research)...

      <figcaption><i>Open the Grafana app</i></figcaption>
    </div>
    
3. Navigate to the Explore section and select ‚ÄòThanos‚Äô as a source and search for the metric `cpu_container_usage_total`, and in the label filters select pod and paste the pod name which we have gotten from step 1, then click on ‚ÄòRun Query‚Äô. 
    
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <img src="/products/data_product/observability/cpu/worker/worker_home_explore_thanos_search_jump.png" style="border:1px solid black; width: 70%; height: auto">
      <figcaption><i>Grafana Explore: CPU usage query</i></figcaption>
    </div>
    
4. After clicking on the ‚ÄòRun Query‚Äô, you can find the usage of CPU by the Service.
    
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <img src="/products/data_product/observability/cpu/worker/worker_ally_graph_berea_split_last30minutes.png" style="border:1px solid black; width: 70%; height: auto">
      <figcaption><i>CPU usage by container over time</i></figcaption>
    </div>
    
    This graph displays cumulative CPU usage (`container_cpu_usage_seconds_total`) for each container inside a pod belonging to the `sales360-worker` Worker:
    
    - **Green line:** Represents the container named `sales360-worker`, with cumulative CPU usage of 41.53 seconds, indicating this is the primary workload container.
    - **Yellow line:** Another container in the same pod with usage of 46.86 seconds, showing it consumed slightly more CPU over time.
    - **Blue line:** A third container in the pod with usage of 0.025 seconds, reflecting very minimal CPU activity during the observed period.
    
    Each line represents a different container inside the same pod, and the variation in CPU usage reflects the different computational responsibilities handled by each container.
    
5. To monitor the memory usage, select the `container_memory_working_set_bytes` in the query explorer and select the pod name as the label filter of the corresponding Service, and run the query.
    
    <div style="text-align: center;">

      <figcaption><i>Grafana Explore: memory working set query</i></figcaption>
    </div>
    
6. On executing the query, you can see the memory used by the pod in the last thirty minutes. 
    
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <img src="/products/data_product/observability/cpu/worker/worker_split_last5minutes_cscc_queries_berea.png" style="border:1px solid black; width: 70%; height: auto">
      <figcaption><i>Memory usage by container over time</i></figcaption>
    </div>
    
    This graph displays the cumulative CPU usage (in seconds) at the pod level for the `sales360-worker` Worker. The distinct lines represent total CPU consumed by individual containers within the same pod, but together, they reflect the overall CPU footprint of the pod.
    
    The green and yellow lines accumulating around 46 seconds indicate that the pod performed sustained computational activity across multiple containers. Meanwhile, the blue line remains nearly flat, contributing negligible CPU usage, which reduces the pod‚Äôs total CPU footprint only marginally.
    
    This distribution shows that the pod‚Äôs CPU demand is primarily driven by two containers, with the third playing a minimal runtime role. When monitoring pod-level efficiency, such patterns help in resource right-sizing and isolating CPU-intensive components.
    
7. You can further select the time range at which you want to see the CPU and memory usage.
