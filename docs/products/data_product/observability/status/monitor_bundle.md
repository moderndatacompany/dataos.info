# Monitor the Status of the Bundle

In DataOS, the status of a Resource indicates its current life-cycle state, such as `active`, `error`, or `deleted`. Monitoring status allows teams to detect state transitions (e.g., from `active` to `deleted` or `error`) that may impact downstream dependencies, trigger configuration issues, or reflect access problems. 

## DataOS CLI

The status of a Bundle can be monitored using the DataOS CLI by executing the following command. This command will list all the Bundles created by the user.

```bash
dataos-ctl get -t bundle
```

**Example Usage:**

```bash
dataos-ctl get -t bundle 
INFO[0000] üîç get...                                     
INFO[0001] üîç get...complete                             

        NAME          | VERSION |      TYPE       | WORKSPACE | STATUS | RUNTIME |    OWNER     
----------------------|---------|-----------------|-----------|--------|---------|--------------
 azure-billing-bundle | v1bets  |     bundle      |           | active |         | iamgroot   
```

In the example above, the `STATUS` column indicates the current state of the Bundle `active` in this case, which confirms that the Bundle is available and usable. 

## Metis UI

To monitor the status of Bundle on the Metis Catalog UI, follow the steps below:

1. Open the Metis Catalog.
    
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <img src="/products/data_product/observability/status/instance_secret/instance_secret_metis_catalog_endtoend_metadata_management.png" style="border:1px solid black; width: 70%; height: auto">
      <figcaption><i>Open the Metis Catalog</i></figcaption>
    </div>
    
2. Search for a Bundle by name.
    
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <img src="/products/data_product/observability/status/bundle/bundle_bundle_azure_bundles_azurebillingbundle_ctrl.png" style="border:1px solid black; width: 70%; height: auto">
      <figcaption><i>Search the Bundle in Metis</i></figcaption>
    </div>
    
3. Click on the Bundle that needs to be monitored and check the Status, which is represented as `State`.
    
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <img src="/products/data_product/observability/status/bundle/bundle_bundles_meta_version_created_days.png" style="border:1px solid black; width: 70%; height: auto">
      <figcaption><i>Bundle details in Metis</i></figcaption>
    </div>
    

The `active` state indicates that the Bundle is currently accessible and usable by other DataOS Resources.  This is the expected state for any Bundle that is in use by other DataOS Resources.

## Operations App

To monitor the status of Bundle on the Operations app, follow the steps below:

1. Open the Operations app.
    
    <div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="/products/data_product/observability/status/instance_secret/instance_secret_operations_administer_data0s_grafana.png" style="border:1px solid black; width: 70%; height: auto">
    <figcaption><i>Open the Operations app</i></figcaption>
    </div>
    
2. Under the User space ‚Üí type ‚Üí Bundle, search for the Bundle by name.
    
    <div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="/products/data_product/observability/status/bundle/bundle_adataos_operations_userspace_core_kernel.png" style="border:1px solid black; width: 70%; height: auto">
    <figcaption><i>Operations > User Space > Bundle</i></figcaption>
    </div>
    
    The `active` status indicates that the Resource is valid and available for use within DataOS. This is the expected state for a healthy and usable Resource.
    
3. On clicking the Bundle, its builder state can also be monitored.
    
    <aside class="callout">
    üó£ The Builder Stage reflects the internal progress of a DataOS Resource as it is being reconciled and provisioned by the platform. This stage is managed by the Poros controller, which is responsible for ensuring the system‚Äôs actual state matches the desired state defined in the Resource manifest (YAML).
    
    When a user applies a Resource YAML (`dataos-ctl resource apply -f resource.yaml`), the builder workflow begins. Poros orchestrates this by comparing the input state (what the user requested) with the current cluster state (what already exists), and attempts to reconcile the two.
    
    If a Resource enters an `error` state during this stage, it means something failed while setting it up. A Resource in an error state at the Builder Stage is considered not fully created and should not be treated as active, even if it appears in the UI list.
    
    </aside>
    
    <div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="/products/data_product/observability/status/bundle/bundle_dataos_operations_user_spac_user.png" style="border:1px solid black; width: 70%; height: auto">
    <figcaption><i>Bundle details in Operations</i></figcaption>
    </div>
    
    Monitoring the Builder Stage is recommended when the Resource status shows an `error`.
    
    - If the status is `error` and the Builder Stage is still `building`, it indicates that the issue occurred after the building stage.
    - If the status is `error` and the Builder Stage also shows `error`, it means the issue happened during the building stage itself.
    
    This helps in identifying whether the problem lies within the building phase or after the Resource was built.
    

## Status alerts

To automatically track critical state transitions, users can configure a Monitor and Pager to send alerts when the status of a Bundle changes to values like `error` or `deleted`. This enables teams to respond immediately to resource failures, misconfigurations, or unexpected deletions that may impact dependent components.
