## **Prerequisites**

- It is assumed that you possess a basic understanding of Bitbucket.

- Before proceeding, ensure you have access to the [repository template](https://bitbucket.org/tmdc/dp-repo-template-v2/src/master/) and the necessary tags or use cases.

## **Steps to Create the Data Product Template**

Follow these steps to create the Data Product template:

1. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
    - Open your terminal and create a virtual environment using the command:
        
        ```bash
        python -m venv envname
        ```
        
    - Activate the virtual environment:
        
        ```bash
        source envname/bin/activate
        ```
        
2. **Install Cookiecutter**:
    - Install Cookiecutter using pip in the activated environment:
        
        ```bash
        pip install cookiecutter
        ```
        
3. **Clone the Repository**:
    - Open the [repository link](https://bitbucket.org/tmdc/dp-repo-template-v2/src/master/) in your browser.
    - Click on "Clone" and select `HTTPS`. Copy the provided link.
        
        <div style="text-align: center;">
        <img src="/products/data_product/recipes/cc.png" alt="username_mapping" />
        </div>   
        
4. **Run Cookiecutter**:
    - In your terminal, run the following command, replacing `<bitbucket-username>` with your Bitbucket username and `<repository-link>` with the copied link:
        
        ```bash
        cookiecutter https://<bitbucket-username>@<repository-link>
        ```
        
    - Follow the prompts and provide the required details to create the data product template. Prompt will include the following keys:
        - data_product_name (Customer Overview)
        - directory_name (fs-dp-testing_dp)
        - table_name (testing_dp_dp)
        - table_name_raw (testing_dp_raw)
        - dataset_context (testing_dp)
        - blob_relative_path (finance_service)
        - source_depot (twdepot)
        - destination_depot (icebasetw)
        - incremental_context (table1_context)
        - primary_key (cust_id)
    - After successfully executing the above step, in your local system, a new directory will be created by the name you provided during the prompt.

5. **Create a New Repository**:
    - Create a new repository on Bitbucket with a README file.
    - Copy the HTTP link of the newly created repository.

6. **Clone the Repository**:
    - In any directory on your local system, run the following command, replacing `<repository-link>` with the copied link:
        
        ```bash
        git clone <repository-link>
        ```
        
7. **Open Directories in Code Editor**:
    - Open both directories (the previously cloned directory and the newly created directory) in your preferred code editor (e.g., VS Code) within the same workspace.

8. **Move Files**:
    - Move all the files from the previously cloned directory to your newly created directory.

9. **Push Changes**:
    - Push the changes to your new repository in Bitbucket.

10. **Verify Changes**:
    - Verify that all changes are reflected in your Bitbucket repository.

By following these steps, you'll have a successfully created Data Product template in your Bitbucket repository. This template can now be customized and further developed according to the requirements and can be deployed using the CI/CD pipeline.
