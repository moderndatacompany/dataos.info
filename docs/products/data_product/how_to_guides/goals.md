# Define Usecase

The development of a Data Product initialized by defining the use cases, a single data product can cater to multiple use cases and all the way around. The use case for this particular example is to analyze the Website Traffic Source. This analysis provides actionable insights, enabling data-driven decision-making to optimize marketing strategies and improve business outcomes. The intended audience includes data analysts, marketing teams, business stakeholders, and technical teams responsible for data product development. The requirements for this use case include access to data source, an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process to clean and transform raw data, a data model to structure the transformed data, and visualization tools to present the analysis results. Additionally, secure data handling and storage must be ensured throughout the process.
