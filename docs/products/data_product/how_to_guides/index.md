# Data Product Development Life-cycle

The Data Product Development Life Cycle is a step-by-step process for creating and managing a Data Product to provide value. 
To know more about each phase, please explore below sections.

## Design

The Design phase of the Data Product life-cycle is pivotal in aligning business objectives with actionable solutions. It begins with a comprehensive understanding of business goals and use cases, forming the basis for developing a robust solution architecture. DataOS resources required to design a Data Product are [Instance Secret](/resources/instance_secret/), [Depot](/resources/depot/), [Cluster](/resources/cluster/), and [Stacks](/resources/stacks/). DataOS also provides interfaces that help to design the Data Product such as [Data Product Hub](/interfaces/data_product_hub) where you can explore existing Data Products, [Workbench](/interfaces/workbench) to query your data source without moving the data, and [Metis](/interfaces/metis) to get insight about the data. To know more in detail, please refer to  [How to Design a Data Product](/products/data_product/how_to_guides/design/).

## Build

The Build phase involves coding, configurations, and integrations to build data pipelines, application logic, and interfaces according to the solution architecture. Rigorous testing ensures functionality, performance, and reliability, with ongoing stakeholder collaboration to validate that the built product aligns with business objectives and technical specifications. To know more in detail, please refer to [How to Build a Data Product](/products/data_product/how_to_guides/build/).

## Deploy
The Deploy phase of Data Product life-cycle emphasis on making Data Products available for Data Product personas. To know more, please refer to [How to Deploy a Data Product](/products/data_product/how_to_guides/deploy/).

## Iterate
The Iterate phase in the Data Product life-cycle focuses on continuous improvement and refinement based on feedback, usage patterns, and evolving business needs. It involves analyzing user interactions, performance metrics, and gathering stakeholder feedback to identify areas for enhancement or adjustment.
