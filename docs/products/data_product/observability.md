Observability in the context of Data Products is the practice of continuously monitoring and understanding the state, performance, and reliability of the product. It ensures that Data Products function as intended, are reliable, and meet service-level objectives (SLOs). The observability framework includes monitoring data quality, operational metrics, and Resource behavior through observability Resources such as Monitors and Pagers.

## Tracking Resource status and runtime

The status and runtime (if applicable) of the Resources used to create a Data Product can be observed via DataOS CLI, Operations app, or Metis app. Monitor Resource is used to track the status and runtime of the Resource and raise an incident whenever the status or runtime changes from the expected, for example 

cli
operations
metis
monitor (report)

## metric-based monitoring

## Infrastructure monitoring
