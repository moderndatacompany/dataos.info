# DataOS Philosophy & Values [WIP]

We believe that more than just the technology used behind to build such a system, a data operating system must help the users derive certain outcomes for their organisation. Some of the core values of our belief system have been enlisted on this page, along with an overview of the way DataOS components are used to attain these values.

- Make DataOps efficient
- Open Standards
- Data-as-a-software
- Data democratisation
- A programmable platform; not an assimilation of point solution

While using DataOS, it can become overwhelming to deal with all the numerous features and new components within. Instead of getting lost in the chatter by thinking about different stacks and applications, we would suggest to approach DataOS the way it was built to be used - through primitives and core applications.

We believe in API first, CLI second and UI third philosophy. As a result, the users have complete flexibility in terms of how they want to use DataOS. Being an API first system built on open-standards, you can use DataOS as an operational layer on top of their existing data infrastructure. This means you do not need to rip & replace the tools and point solutions you already have, and can simply use DataOS to manage widely different tools in a consistent manner - you will also be able to leverage the core features of DataOS like the native governance, metadata management and data activation capabilities. 

With DataOS we hope to provide the users with a programmable system to deliver high quality data in a governed and secured fashion.
