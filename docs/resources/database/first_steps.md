# Database: First Steps

## Create a Database

To create a Database, the first step is to create a Database manifest file. But before creating a Database  Resource, ensure you have required use-cases assigned.

### **Get Appropriate Access Permission Use Case**

In DataOS, different actions require specific use cases that grant the necessary permissions to execute a task. You can grant these use cases directly to a user or group them under a tag, which is then assigned to the user. The following table outlines various actions related to Database  Resource and the corresponding use cases required:

| **Action** | **Required Use Cases** |
|------------|------------------------|
| Get        | Read Workspaces, Read Resources in User Specified Workspace / Read Resources in User Workspaces (for public and sandbox workspaces) |
| Create     | Create and Update Resources in User Workspace       |
| Apply      | Create and Update Resources in User Workspace          |
| Delete     | Delete Resources in User Workspace               |
| Log        | Read Resource Logs in User Workspace                 |

To assign use cases, you can either contact the DataOS Operator or create a Grant Request by creating a [Grant](/resources/grant/) Resource. The request will be validated by the DataOS Operator.

### **Create a manifest file**

To create a Database Resource, data developers can define a set of attributes in a manifest file, typically in YAML format, and deploy it using the DataOS Command Line Interface (CLI) or API. Below is a sample manifest file for Database Resource:

???tip "Sample Database manifest"
    
    ```yaml title="sample_worker.yml"
    --8<-- "examples/resources/database/database.yaml"
    ```

The manifest for creating a Database has the following two sections, each requiring specific configuration:

- [Resource meta section](#resource-meta-section)
- [Database-specific Section](#database-specific-section)

#### **Resource meta section**

In DataOS, a Database is categorized as a Resource-type. The Resource meta section within the manifest file encompasses attributes applicable to all Resource-types. The provided manifest file elucidates the requisite attributes for this section:

=== "Syntax"

    ```yaml
    #Attribtues for Resource
    name: ${resource-name}                #database_name 
    version: v1                           
    type: database                        
    description: ${description}
    tags:
      - ${tag1}
      - ${tag2}
    owner: ${iamgroot}
    layer: ${user}
    database: 
      #database specific mapping(mandatory)
    ```
=== "Sample"

    ```yaml
    #Attribtues for Resource
    name: products_db
    version: v1                           #database_name 
    type: database                        
    description: product database created for testing.
    tags:
      - database
    database: #database specific mapping(mandatory)
    owner: iamgroot
    layer: user 
    ```

To configure a Database Resource, replace the values of `name`, `layer`, `tags`, `description`, and `owner` with appropriate values. For additional configuration information about the attributes of the Resource meta section, refer to the link: [Attributes of Resource meta section](/resources/manifest_attributes/).

#### **Database-specific section**

The Database-specific section of a Database manifest comprises attributes-specific to the Database Resource.


=== "Syntax"

    ```yaml
    database:                            # Specify the resource type
      migrate:
        includes:
          - ${migration-directory}     # Address to all migrations (relative path)
        includesInline:
          migration: |
            ${migration_script}

        command: ${migration-command}   # ("up" or "down")
      compute: runnable-default
    ```
=== "Sample"

    ```yaml
    database:                            # Specify the resource type
      migrate:
        includes:
          - migrations/  
        includesInline:
          migration: |                    # Address to all migrations (relative path)
            CREATE TABLE Product (
            id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
            name VARCHAR(100),
            price DECIMAL(10, 2),
            description TEXT);
        command: up  # Specify the migration command (e.g., "up" or "drop table")
      compute: runnable-default
    ```


**Migrate Configuration**

The migration in Database Resource typically involves defining changes to a Database schema, such as creating or altering tables, adding or modifying columns, or establishing relationships between tables.

???note "Example migration"

    ```sql  title="001_create.up.sql"

        CREATE TABLE user (
        user_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
        username VARCHAR(50),
        email VARCHAR(100),
        created_at TIMESTAMP
        );
    ```
    ```sql title="002_insert.up.sql"
        INSERT INTO user (user_id, username, email, created_at) VALUES
        (1, 'JohnDoe', 'john@example.com', '2024-03-29 10:00:00'),
        (2, 'JaneSmith', 'jane@example.com', '2024-03-29 11:00:00'),
        (3, 'AliceJones', 'alice@example.com', '2024-03-29 12:00:00');

        -- Removing the added column
        ALTER TABLE users
        DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS created_at;
    ```
    ``` sql title="0021_drop.down.sql"
    -- Dropping the new table
        DROP TABLE IF EXISTS users;
    ```

There are two ways to define migrations: .

- Embed an external directory for migration.
- Provide the migration within the Database manifest.

===  "External to manifest"

    To embed an external scripts for migration, create a folder with name say `migration`. In your migration folder, create a new SQL file, e.g., `001_migration_up.sql`, and write the migration script to define the changes to the Database schema.

    === "Syntax"

          ```yaml
          migrate:
            includes:
              - ${migration_folder_path}  #address to all migrations
          ```
    === "Example"
        
          ```yaml
          migrate:
            includes:
              - migration/
          ```

===  "Embedded within manifest"

      Inline migration involves embedding migration logic directly within the manifest file. While simpler to implement for small projects, it may lead to complexity for long complex migrations.


    === "Syntax"

        ```yaml
        migrate:
          includesInline:
            migration: |
              ${sql script}
        ```

    === "Example"

        ```yaml
        migrate:
          includesInline:
            migration: |
              CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS products(
              sproduct_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
              product_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
              category VARCHAR(50),
              price NUMERIC(10, 2) NOT NULL,
              stock_quantity INT NOT NULL,
              description TEXT,
              created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);
        ```

!!!info "ðŸ“– Best Practice"

      - Numeric Prefixing:
          Prefix filenames with a numeric sequence for a clear execution order.
      - File Naming Format:
          Use `<anything>.up.sql` and `<anything>.down.sql` for migration files.

        - Example:

        ```sql title="migration/"
        001_initialize.up.sql
        001_initialize.down.sql
        002_add_column.up.sql
        002_add_column.down.sql
        003_update_data.up.sql
        003_update_data.down.sql
        ```          

#### **Database Migrations**

The Database attribute `migrate` consists of two commands, one to migrate `up` and another to migrate `down`. The `up` migration is responsible for applying changes to the database schema, facilitating the transition to a newer version. Conversely, the `down` migration serves the purpose of reverting changes made by the "up" migration. This is crucial for scenarios requiring a rollback to a previous version. Below is an example SQL script (`001_migration_down.sql`) demonstrating actions taken.

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="/resources/database/migration.png" alt="Database Migration " style="border:1px solid black; width: 80%; height: auto;">
  <figcaption><i>Database Migration </i></figcaption>
</div>

### **Apply the Database manifest**

After successfully creating the Database manifest, itâ€™s time to apply manifest. To apply the Database manifest file to create a Resource-instance within the DataOS environment, utilize the `apply` command.

=== "Command"

    ```bash
    dataos-ctl resource apply -f ${manifest-file-path} -w ${workspace-name}
    ```

=== "Example"

    ```bash
    dataos-ctl resource apply -f database.yaml -w curriculum
    # Expected Output
    INFO[0000] ðŸ›  apply...                                   
    INFO[0000] ðŸ”§ applying(curriculum) products_db:v1:database... 
    INFO[0027] ðŸ”§ applying(curriculum) products_db:v1:database...created 
    INFO[0027] ðŸ›  apply...complete
    ```

## Manage a Database

### **Verify Database creation**

To check the successful creation of Database in DataOS Workspace use the following two methods:

**Check the Database in a Workspace:** Use the following command to list the created Database in a specific Workspace:

=== "Command"

    ```bash
    dataos-ctl resource get -t database -w ${workspace-name} 
    ```

=== "Example"

    ```bash
    dataos-ctl resource get -t database -w curriculum

    # Expected Output
    |    NAME     | VERSION |   TYPE    |  WORKSPACE  | STATUS | RUNTIME |     OWNER       |
    |-------------|---------|-----------|-------------|--------|---------|-----------------|
    | products_db |   v1    | database  | curriculum  | active |         |     iamgroot    |
    |  products   | v1      | database  |   public    | active |         |    wonderwoman  |   
    |  sampledb01 | v1      | database  |   public    | active |         | captainamerica  |  

    ```
If the status is â€˜activeâ€™, re run or use `-r` to refresh the command to get runtime as â€˜succeededâ€™.

Alternatively, you can also use the following command:

=== "Command"

    ```bash
    dataos-ctl get -t database -w ${workspace-name} 
    ```

=== "Example"

    ```bash
    dataos-ctl get -t database -w curriculum

    # Expected Output
    |    NAME     | VERSION |   TYPE    |  WORKSPACE  | STATUS | RUNTIME |     OWNER       |
    |-------------|---------|-----------|-------------|--------|---------|-----------------|
    | products_db |   v1    | database  | curriculum  | active |         |     iamgroot    |
    |  products   | v1      | database  |   public    | active |         |    wonderwoman  |   
    |  sampledb01 | v1      | database  |   public    | active |         | captainamerica  |  
    ```

**Retrieve all Databases in a Workspace:**

To retrieve the list of all Databases created in the Workspace, add the `-a` flag to the command:
 
=== "Command"
     ```shell
     dataos-ctl resource get -t database -w ${workspace-name} -a
     ```

=== "Example"
     ```shell
     dataos-ctl resource get -t database -w curriculum -a
     ```

### **Getting Database logs**

  ```shell
  dataos-ctl resource get -t database -w curriculum -n products_db -d
  ```

### **Deleting a Database**

As part of best practices, it is recommended to regularly delete Resources that are no longer in use. This practice offers several benefits, and reducing costs.

There are 3 ways to delete Database(or any Resource):

=== "Method 1"

    This method deletes database(or any) based on direct specification of type, name, and workspace.

    === "Command"

        ```shell
        dataos-ctl delete -t ${database} -n ${name of database} -w ${name of workspace}
        ```
    === "Example"

        ```shell
        dataos-ctl delete -t service -n products_db -w curriculum
        ```

=== "Method 2"

    This method deletes based on a specific identifier string obtained from a status query.    

    === "Command"

        ```shell
        dataos-ctl delete -i ${name of database in the output table from get status command}
        ```
    === "Example"

        ```shell
        dataos-ctl delete -i "products_db  | v1 | database | curriculum"
        ```

=== "Method 3"

    This method deletes based on information stored in a configuration file.

    === "Command"

        ```shell
        dataos-ctl delete -f ${file-path}
        ```
    === "Example"

        ```shell
        dataos-ctl delete -f home/iamgroot/database/database_product.yml
        ```

## **Create a Beacon Service**

Create a [Beacon](/resources/stacks/beacon/) Service to expose the PostgreSQL database on API. The syntax for the Beacon Service manifest file is provided below:

```yaml title="service.yaml" hl_lines="14"
--8<-- "examples/resources/database/service.yaml"
```
For detailed customization options and additional attributes of the Service Resource Section, refer to the link [Attributes of Service Section](/resources/service/configurations/).

### **Apply the Service manifest**

=== "Command"

    ```bash
    dataos-ctl resource apply -f ${service file name} -w ${workspace-name} 
    ```

=== "Example"

    ```bash
    dataos-ctl resource apply -f products-service.yaml -w curriculum
    ```

### **Verify Service creation**

To check the successful completion of Service use the following command:

=== "Command"

    ```bash
    dataos-ctl resource get -t service -w {curriculum}
    ```

=== "Example"

    ```bash
    dataos-ctl resource get -t service -w curriculum
    
    #Expected output

    ```bash
          NAME      | VERSION |  TYPE   | WORKSPACE  | STATUS |  RUNTIME  |     OWNER       
    ----------------|---------|---------|------------|--------|-----------|-----------------
      employee-test | v1      | service | curriculum | active | running:1 | iamgroot
      product-test  | v1      | service | curriculum | active | running:1 | iamgroot  
      products-test | v1      | service | curriculum | active | running:1 | iamgroot
    ```
    ```

you can now access the PostgreSQL database using the exposed API by

To validate the outcome, execute a request to the designated URL:

=== "Syntax"

    ```shell
    https://<dataos_fqdn>/<database_path>/<table_name>
    ```

=== "Example"

    ```shell
    https://liberal-donkey.dataos.app/products_db/api/v1/products
    ```
    #Expected Output
    ```json
        0
    id              1
    product_name    "Laptop"
    category        "Electronics"
    price           999.99
    stock_quantity  20
    1
    id              2
    product_name    "Smartphone"
    category        "Electronics"
    price           499.99
    stock_quantity  30
    ```

This action will enable verification of the expected result by accessing the provided endpoint.

### **Deleting a Service**

As you deleted Database, in same manner you can delete the Service after use.

There are 3 ways to delete Service(or any Resource):

=== "Method 1"

    === "Command"

        ```shell
        dataos-ctl delete -t ${service} -n ${name of service} -w{workspace}
        ```
    === "Example"

        ```shell
        dataos-ctl delete -t service -n products-service -w curriculum
        ```

=== "Method 2"

    === "Command"

        ```shell
        dataos-ctl delete -i ${name of service in the output table from get status command}
        ```
    === "Example"

        ```shell
        dataos-ctl delete -i "products-service  | v1 | service | curriculum"
        ```

=== "Method 3"

    
    === "Command"

        ```shell
        dataos-ctl delete -f ${file-path}
        ```
    === "Example"

        ```shell
        dataos-ctl delete -f home/iamgroot/database/service.yml
        ```
