# Error reference

When working with Lens, you may encounter various error messages in logs and API responses. This page provides a list of common errors along with advice for addressing them.

## Can't find join path

Error message above indicates that a query failed because it includes members from lens that can't be joined in order to generate a valid query to the upstream data source.

Please check that you've defined necessary joins and that they have correct directions.

If youâ€™re building a custom data application, you might use the meta endpoint of the REST API. It will help select those ones that can be joined together.

## Can't parse timestamp

Error message above indicates that the data source was unable to recognize the value of a time dimension as a timestamp.

## Primary key is required when join is defined

Error message above indicates that you have a lens with joins. However, that lens doesn't have a primary key.
