## Single source

When data resides in a single source such as AWS Redshift, BigQuery, PostgreSQL, or Snowflake, the semantic model is built directly on top of the source.

-   [**AWS Redshift**](/resources/lens/data_sources/awsredshift/)  
    Cloud data warehouse source.

-   [**BigQuery**](/resources/lens/data_sources/bigquery/)  
    Cloud data warehouse source.

-   [**Snowflake**](/resources/lens/data_sources/snowflake/)  
    Cloud data warehouse source.

-   [**Databricks**](/resources/lens/data_sources/databricks/)  
    Lakehouse platform source.

-   [**Postgres**](/resources/lens/data_sources/postgres/)  
    Relational database source.

## Multiple source

When working with distributed data systems, a unified semantic model is constructed using Minerva or Themis clusters. These clusters facilitate seamless integration across heterogeneous data sources.

-   [**Themis**](/resources/lens/data_sources/themis/)
