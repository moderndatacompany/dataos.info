# Lens Local Setup

Set up the Lens project folder containing the Dockerfile and the model folder and user_groups.yml. 

In the Model folder, you'll define your Lens model, including SQL mapping, logical tables, logical views, and user groups. Each folder has a specific file related to your Lens model


## Step 1: Set Up Lens 2 Project

Set up the Lens2 project folder or you can download this template for 

[lens template](/resources/lens/local_setup/lens-project-template.zip)

- Open the Model folder in the editor of your choice. Your Model folder will have the following hierarchy:

``` bash
model
â”œâ”€â”€ sqls 
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ sample.sql
â”œâ”€â”€ tables 
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ sample_table.yml //A logical table definition includes joins, dimensions, measures, and segments. 
â”œâ”€â”€ views 
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ sample_view.yml //View reference dimensions, measures, and segments from tables.
â””â”€â”€ user_groups.yml //User groups organize users for easier policy application.
```

- **`sqls` Folder**
    - This directory will contain SQL scripts corresponding to the dimensions of your tables.  A dedicated SQL file needs to be maintained for each table. The SQL dialect used will be source-specific.
- **Create `tables` Folder**
    - This directory will store your logical tables, with each table defined in a separate YAML file.
- **Create `views` Folder**
    - This directory will store all your logical views.
1. **Add user_groups.yml**
    - User groups organize users for easier policy applications to control access.
    - Presently, we have a 'default' user group defined in the YAML that includes all users.

2.  Configure the docker-compose.yml file to add data source details and update Lens meta details.

## Configure the docker-compose manifest file

The `docker-compose.yml` file defines how to set up and run your Docker containers for Lens 2.0. Customize this file to fit your specific environment and requirements.

Syntax and Example

```bash
version: "2.2"

x-lens2-environment: &lens2-environment

# DataOS

DATAOS_FQDN: <dataos_fqdn>.dataos.app #add the URL for the environment. Ensure you are passing the API key for this env

# Overview

LENS2_NAME: lens_name
LENS2_DESCRIPTION: "Purpose of the lens"
LENS2_TAGS: "lens2, ecommerce, sales and customer insights" #add tags for better discoverability
LENS2_AUTHORS: "author_name" #add the owner name here
LENS2_SCHEDULED_REFRESH_TIMEZONES: "UTC,America/Vancouver,America/Toronto"

# Data Source

# This defines env variables for connecting to the source via the depot

LENS2_SOURCE_TYPE: ${depot}
LENS2_SOURCE_NAME: ${depot_name}
LENS2_SOURCE_CATALOG_NAME: ${catalog_name}
DATAOS_RUN_AS_APIKEY: ******   #USER APIKEY

# Log

LENS2_LOG_LEVEL: error
CACHE_LOG_LEVEL: "trace"

# Operation

LENS2_DEV_MODE: true
LENS2_DEV_MODE_PLAYGROUND: false
LENS2_REFRESH_WORKER: true
LENS2_SCHEMA_PATH: model
LENS2_PG_SQL_PORT: 5432
CACHE_DATA_DIR: "/var/work/.store"
NODE_ENV: production

services:
api:
restart: always
image: rubiklabs/lens2:0.35.18-50
ports:
- 4000:4000
- 25432:5432
- 13306:13306
environment:
<<: *lens2-environment

volumes:
- ./model:/etc/dataos/work/model
```

Modify the docker-compose.yml file to tailor it to include environment-URL, lens meta info, and, source details as per your requirement - 

1. **Adjust the environment URL according to your preferences.**
    
```yaml
# edit this section in your docker-compose.yml file
# DataOS
  DATAOS_FQDN: emerging-hawk.dataos.app #add the URL for the environment you prefer to use. 
```
    
2. **Update Lens meta info, including name, description, tags, and author details.**
    
```yaml
# Overview
  LENS2_NAME: lens_name 
  LENS2_DESCRIPTION: "Purpose of the lens"
  LENS2_TAGS: "lens2, ecom, sales and customer insights" #add tags for better discoverability
  LENS2_AUTHORS: "author_name" #add the owner name here
  LENS2_SCHEDULED_REFRESH_TIMEZONES: "UTC,America/Vancouver,America/Toronto"
```

3. **Customize the source details:**

- If connecting via the depot, refer to the provided environmental variables in the syntax below. Currently, supported depot types include - JDBC, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MS SQL, Snowflake, Bigquery, and Redshift.
        
**(Ensure you have access to the compute of the source. This needs to be verified at source end.)**

Environment variable for connecting via depot

```yaml
  # Data Source
  # This defines env variables for connecting to the source via the depot
  LENS2_SOURCE_TYPE: depot
  LENS2_SOURCE_NAME: depot_name #add the name of the depot 
  DATAOS_RUN_AS_APIKEY: ****** # Add the user API Key for the env
```

Environment variable to connect via Minerva or Themis

```yaml
  # Data Source
  # This defines env variables for connecting to the source via the cluster
  LENS2_SOURCE_TYPE: minerva #If you want to connect via Themis, change the source type to Themis 
  LENS2_SOURCE_NAME: cluster_name #add the cluster name
  LENS2_SOURCE_CATALOG_NAME: catalog_name #add the catalog name
  DATAOS_RUN_AS_APIKEY: ******
```
        
    
- If connecting without a depot, consult the [environmental variables guide](https://www.notion.so/Supported-Sources-5d0da3eaf1b14eca82e4d7d1aafe6b86?pvs=21) for different sources, as each may require a specific set of settings.

4. **Verify Service Configuration:**
    - make sure the image tag is up to date or is the same as the one you pulled in the prerequisite stage.

## Starting Lens Locally

Once you've completed the Lens 2.0 setup(adding source connection detail) and have defined the Lens model you can start Lens. 

> **Note:** Ensure your working directory is the Lens project directory
> 

You can start Lens locally by running:

=== "Code"

    ```bash
    docker-compose up  #run docker-compose up command in terminal
    ```

=== "Output"

    The output lo like following indicates that the lens server has started locally

    ```bash
    lens2-api-1  | Loaded  /app/scripts/config.js
    lens2-api-1  | ðŸ”¥ Table Store (0.35.40) is assigned to 3030 port.
    lens2-api-1  | ðŸ”— Lens2 SQL Service (PostgreSQL) is listening on 0.0.0.0:5432
    lens2-api-1  | ðŸš€ Lens2 API server (0.35.41-05) is listening on 4000
    ```
