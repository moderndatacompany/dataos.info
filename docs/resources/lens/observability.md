# Observe and monitor a semantic model and Lens

The Lens and its semantic model can be observed and monitored at the following three levels:

1. [Metric monitoring](/resources/lens/observability#metric-monitoring-of-the-lens)

2. [Operational monitoring](/resources/lens/observability#operational-monitoring-of-the-lens)

3. [Infrastructure monitoring](/resources/lens/observability#infrastructure-monitoring-of-the-lens-service-using-grafana)

## Metric monitoring of the Lens

Metric monitoring in Lens is done by Monitor and Pager Resource focuses on tracking the performance and health of the Lens Resources. It helps in measuring key indicators that define the state of the system. A Lens Resource can be monitored using Monitor and Pager Resources. Two types of Monitors can be applied to observe the state of the deployed Lens and the matrix of the semantic model.

* [Equation monitor](/resources/lens/observability#equation-monitor)

* [Report monitor](/resources/lens/observability#report-monitor)

### **Equation Monitor**

Equation Monitor observes the Lens and it's semantic model's smetrics to generate the incidents when the condition meets.

**1. Create Equation Monitor**

Copy and make the necessary changes in the following equation monitor manifest file.

Runs every 2 mins to check if `total_customers` in the customer table (from the `productaffinity` semantic model) drops below 50 i.e. `total_customers < 50`. If true, it triggers an info-level incident: `lens-customer-analysis`. 

```yaml
# metrics monitor

name: monitor-lens-metric-testing
version: v1alpha
type: monitor
runAsUser: iamgroot
monitor:
  schedule: '*/2 * * * *'
  type: equation_monitor
  equation:
    leftExpression:
      queryCoefficient: 1
      queryConstant: 0
      query:
        type: lens
        lens:
          dataOsInstance:
            name: productaffinity
            workspace: public
            sslmode: 'disable'
        ql: SELECT total_customers FROM customer 
        comparisonColumn: {
            name: total_customers,
            dataType: int64
        }
    rightExpression:
      queryCoefficient: 0
      queryConstant: 50
    operator: less_than
  incident:
    type: business-metric
    name: lens-customer-analysis
    category: equation
    severity: info

```

**2. Deploy the Equation Monitor**

Deploy the Equation Monitor using the following `apply` command.

```shell
dataos-ctl resource apply {manifest-file-path}
```
**3. Validate the created Equation Monitor**

Validate the creation of Equation monitor and check status using the `get` command:

=== "Command"

    ```shell
    dataos-ctl get -t monitor -w <WORKSPACE_NAME>
    ```
=== "Example"

    ```shell
    dataos-ctl get -t monitor -w curriculum
    ```
  

**4. Get the runtime of the Equation Monitor** 

Get the runtime of the Equation Monitor using the `get runtime` command:

=== "Command"

    ```shell
    dataos-ctl get runtime -t monitor -n <MONITOR_NAME> -w <WORKSPACE_NAME> 
    ```

=== "Example"

    ```shell
    dataos-ctl get runtime -t monitor -n lens-monitor -w curriculum 
    ```



### **Equation Pager**

The following configuration defines a Pager Resource named `lens-equation-monitoring-pager` used for sending alerts to a Microsoft Teams channel when specific conditions related to a Lens Resource are met. The conditions are defined in the above Equation Monitor manifest file. The pager monitors the `lens-customer-analysis` incident, and when it is triggered, the configured alert is sent.

**1. Create the Pager manifest file**


```yaml
name: lens-equation-monitoring-pager
version: v1alpha
type: pager
tags:
  - dataos:type:resource
  - service-failed-pager
description: This is for sending Alerts on Microsoft Teams Channel.
workspace: public
pager:
  conditions:
    - valueJqFilter: .properties.name
      operator: equals
      value: lens-customer-analysis

  output:
    webHook:
      url: "https://rubikdatasolutions.webhook.office.com/webhookb2/09239cd8-92a8-4d59-9621-9217305bf6ed@2e22bdde-3ec2-43f5-bf92-78e9f35a44fb/IncomingWebhook/0df05b99cc6300c898613/83e4eb41-6095-44d5-b0ba-8da9829e9cff/V2vWPDZYPw0zH-96mHWOn--hQyWI7h41"
      verb: post
      headers:
        'content-type': 'application/json'
      bodyTemplate: |
          {
            "@type": "MessageCard",
            "summary": "Total customers are low.",
            "themeColor": "0076D7",
            "sections": [
              {
                "activityTitle": "Dear Team",
                "activitySubtitle": "Our system detected that the total customer of a high demand product is low-replenish-rate."
              }
            ]
          }
```

**2. Apply the Equation Pager**

Deploy the Pager using the following `apply` command:

```shell
dataos-ctl resource apply -f {manifest-file-path}
```
**3. Validate the creation of Equation Pager**

```shell
dataos-ctl get -t pager -w <WORKSPACE_NAME>
```
**4. Check the MS Teams for incident**

The above pager raised the incident as shown in the below image:

<img src="/resources/lens/observability/metric_pager_teams_notification.png" 
     alt="Image Description" 
     style="width: 60%; height: auto; border: 1px solid black; border-radius: 4px;">

### **Report Monitor**

The Report Monitor is designed to monitor and match string values, such as the status or runtime of a DataOS resource. It leverages the DataOS API to retrieve real-time data, providing visibility into the operational state and performance of resources. This tool is handy for tracking the ongoing status of resources and ensuring they operate as expected within the system.

The following section outlines the steps to create a Report Monitor Resource that triggers an incident when the state of a Lens changes from 'active' to 'deleted'. Before proceeding, ensure you have the necessary permissions to create a Monitor Resource.

**1. Create a Report Monitor to observe the semantic model**

Copy the template and replace the Lens name with the actual Lens name.

```yaml
# Resource meta section
name: lens-status-monitor
version: v1alpha
type: monitor
tags:
  - dataos:type:resource
  - dataos:layer:user
description: Attention! Lens is deleted
layer: user
monitor:

# Monitor-specific section
  schedule: '*/2 * * * *'
  incident:
    name: lens
    severity: high
    incidentType: lens
    
  type: report_monitor
# Report Monitor specification
  report:
    source:
      dataOsInstance:
          path: /collated/api/v1/reports/resources/status?id=lens:v1alpha:<LENS_NAME>
    conditions:
      - valueComparison:
          observationType: state
          valueJqFilter: '.value'
          operator: equals
          value: deleted
```
**2. Validate the DataOS instance API path**

Before applying the Monitor Resource file, it is recommended to verify the response of the API endpoint using an API testing application like Postman. Add the following URL with `GET` request to test.

```
https://<DATAOS-FQDN>/collated/api/v1/reports/resources/status?id=lens:v1alpha:<LENS_NAME>:<WORKSPACE_NAME>
```

Make sure to replace the `<LENS_NAME>` and `<WORKSPACE_NAME>` placeholders with the name of the workspace and Lens.

<img src="/resources/lens/observability/postman.png" 
     alt="Image Description" 
     style="width: 70%; height: auto; border: 1px solid black; border-radius: 4px;">


A status code of 200 indicates that you can proceed further.

**3. Apply the Monitor manifest file**

After validating the API endpoint, the next step is to apply the Monitor manifest file by executing the code below.

```shell
dataos-ctl resource apply -f ${{path-of-your-manifest-file}}
```

**4. Validate the Monitor**

Validate or check the runtime of the Monitor by executing the below command.

```shell
dataos-ctl get runtime -t monitor -w curriculum -n <MONITOR_NAME> -r 
```

```shell
dataos-ctl get runtime -t monitor -w curriculum -n s-monitor1 -r

      verb: post
      headers:
        'content-type': 'application/json'
      bodyTemplate: |
          {
            "@type": "MessageCard",
            "summary": "Lens is active",
            "themeColor": "0076D7",
            "sections": [
              {
                "activityTitle": "Dear Team,",
                "activitySubtitle": "Lens is active",
                "activityImage": "https://adaptivecards.io/content/cats/3.png",
                "facts": [
                  {
                    "name": "Following Lens is active",
                    "value": "{{ index (splitn ":" 4 .ReportContext.ResourceId) "_2" }}"
                  },
                  {
                    "name": "Failure Time:",
                    "value": "{{ .CreateTime }}"
                  },
                  {
                    "name": "Severity:",
                    "value": "{{ .Properties.severity }}"
                  },
                  {
                    "name": "Run Details:",
                    "value": "<a href=\"https://${dataos-fqdn}/operations/user-space/resources/resource-runtime?name={{ index (splitn ":" 4 .ReportContext.ResourceId) "_2" }}&type=lens&workspace=public\Operation</a>"

                    "name": "Logs:",
                    "value": "<a href=\"https://${dataos-fqdn}/metis/resources/lens/dataos.public.{{ index (splitn ":" 4 .ReportContext.ResourceId) "_2" }}/run_history\Metis</a>"
                  }
                ]
              },
              {
                "title": "Disclaimer",
                "text": "{{ .Monitor.Description }}"
              }
            ]
          }
```

**2. Apply the manifest file**

Apply the manifest file for Pager Resource using following command in your terminal:

```shell
dataos-ctl resource apply -f ${{path-of-your-manifest-file}}
```

## Operational monitoring of the Lens

Operational monitoring of the Lens and its semantic model can be done through the Operations App and CLI, providing visibility into the state and behavior of Lens Resources, enabling workload performance tracking, historical runtime analysis, and troubleshooting.

When Lens Resource status is pending, it‚Äôs essential to check the services running behind it, such as the API or worker services. These services typically show as successful when the resource is in a `running:1` state. However, if the resource is stuck in a pending state, you can easily troubleshoot by clicking on the specific service to view its error logs. This enables quick identification of any issues preventing the resource from transitioning into a running state.

To observe and monitor the Lens error logs using the Operations app follow the below steps:


#### **Step 1: Navigate to DataOS**

Go to **DataOS Home Page > 'Operations**.

<img src="/resources/lens/observability/operations_app.png" 
     alt="Image Description" 
     style="width: 70%; height: auto; border: 1px solid black; border-radius: 4px;"> 

#### **Step 2: Search Lens**

When you click on the Operations app, it launches with the User Space displayed by default. The Resources tab in the User Space contains the log level information of the resources that DataOS users can create and manage within the platform.

Here, search the name of your Lens the search result will have Lens Resource and it's behind the scenes running services. For instance, the name.
    

#### **Step 3: Click on the Lens services such as API, Worker, Router etc.**

Click on any of the Service with 'pending' state to troubleshoot it. For instance, here we click on the 'productaffinity-api' Service to troubleshoot it. As clicked on the `productaffinity-api` Service a dialog box appears as shown below

<img src="/resources/lens/observability/search_operatiions_app_in_lens.png" 
     alt="Image Description" 
     style="width: 70%; height: auto; border: 1px solid black; border-radius: 4px;">



Here one can observe the status, runtime status, building stage etc. From here click on the Resource Runtime tab.

#### **Step 4: Navigate to the 'Resource Runtime' tab**

In the `productaffinity-api` dialog box navigate to the 'Resource Runtime' tab. On Resource Runtime tab click on the `productaffinity-api` node in the Runtime Node section of the page.

<img src="/resources/lens/observability/resource_runtime_tab.png" 
     alt="Image Description" 
     style="width: 70%; height: auto; border: 1px solid black; border-radius: 4px;">

  
#### **Step 5: Navigate to the Runtime Node Logs tab**

As you navigate to the `productaffinity-api` runtime node the runtime node dialog box opens. It gives the details on the following:

* **Runtime Node Details**: Under Runtime Nodes, click on a node to get the runtime YAML, Logs, and Runtime Node Usage. Here you will get the container details, their state, and pod lifecycle conditions(Ready, PodScheduled‚Ä¶) with a status (True, False or Unknown) that make up the ‚Äòcomputed state‚Äô of a pod at any time.

* **Runtime Node Logs**:Runtime Node Logs provide a near real-time view. These logs provide insights into the current health of the node environment and can be helpful for debugging issues.

<aside class="Callout" >
These Logs are not guaranteed to persist for any length of time and may be cleared as needed.
</aside>

* **Runtime Node YAML**: Inspect the `productaffinity-api` YAML.

* **Runtime Node Usage**¬†Check how much memory and CPU is utilized by a Node.


## Observe and Monitor Query Statistics across data sources

¬†To observe and monitor the source query statistics and to find¬†out which tables in the database are most heavily used, i.e. the number of users queried¬†the table, the number of times it was¬†queried, etc., Navigate to the respective query monitoring tools for each source. These tools provide insights into query execution, performance metrics, and resource utilization, enabling efficient analysis and optimization. For Minerva and Themis Clusters, this can be managed directly within the Operations App.

### **Check Query Stats for Minerva**

To check the query statistics, please follow the steps below:

**Step 1: Go to Operations app ‚Üí 'Minerva Queries' tab**

## Infrastructure monitoring of the Lens Service using Grafana

Grafana offers robust capabilities to monitor and visualize critical Lens service performance metrics such as CPU usage, memory consumption, network traffic, and more. These monitoring capabilities are especially useful for services that require constant oversight to ensure optimal performance, such as Lens services and Flash service deployments.

In a Lens deployment, three core services are typically running: API, Worker, and Router. If Flash is used as a data source, a fourth service is included. This gives a total of four services to monitor, each of which can be tracked for performance metrics like CPU usage and memory consumption.

For instance, suppose the Flash Service is scheduled to run at 12:00 PM every day. Using Grafana, a dashboard can be configured to monitor its CPU usage and memory consumption over time, providing detailed insights into resource utilization and allowing for effective monitoring.

**1. Defining Resource requests and limits**

When deploying the Flash service, resource requests and limits are defined in the YAML configuration file. These settings control the amount of CPU and memory allocated to the service, ensuring it operates within specified boundaries.

Here‚Äôs a simplified example of the YAML configuration:

```yaml
resources:
    requests:  #Requests define the minimum resources required to run the service.
        CPU: 1000m
        memory: 2Gi

    limits: #Limits specify the maximum resources that the service can consume, ensuring it does not exceed resource thresholds.
        CPU: 48000m
        memory: 450Gi
```

**2. Create dashboard and monitor usage**

After the Flash service is deployed, a Grafana dashboard should be created to monitor key metrics such as CPU usage and memory consumption. This dashboard will provide real-time data about how resources are being utilized over time. 

After monitoring the Flash Service for a period of time, the actual resource usage can be observed on the Grafana dashboard. For example:

* **CPU usage:** The dashboard might show a peak of 380m CPU usage, well below the maximum limit of 48000m.
* **Memory usage:** The memory usage might peak between 254GB to 500GB, which is lower than the maximum limit of 450Gi.

Based on this observed data, resource requests and limits can be adjusted to optimize usage:

* **CPU adjustment:** If actual CPU usage peaks at `380m`, you can reduce the requested CPU from 1000m to something more appropriate, such as `500m`.
* **Memory adjustment:** If memory usage does not exceed `350Gi` regularly, you can reduce the limit from `450Gi` to `350Gi`.
* **Set up alerts for usage limit exceedance** Grafana allows you to set up alerts that notify you when the service exceeds predefined resource thresholds. For example:

  * **CPU Alert:** Set an alert to trigger if CPU usage exceeds 90% for 5 minutes.
  * **Memory Alert:** Set an alert to notify when memory usage exceeds 90% of the requested limit.

These alerts can be sent via various channels like email, MS Teams, or other messaging systems to ensure immediate action can be taken if resource usage crosses critical limits.

A list of Kubernetes dashboards will appear. To view the pod service of the Lens, check the 'Kubernetes/Views/Pods' checkbox.

After checking the Pods checkbox, the dashboard page will load. Configure the Kubernetes source and namespace settings to monitor the desired pod. The configuration should be as follows:

- **Datasource**: thanos
- **Cluster**: None
- **Namespace**: Enter the name of the workspace where the Lens is deployed (e.g., `public`, `curriculum`, `sandbox`).
- **Pod**: Search for the name of the Lens pod. Pod names start with the Lens name itself. For example, if the Lens name is `productaffinity`, the pod name will also begin with productaffinity. The Lens deployment includes services such as api, router, and worker. For example, to monitor the api service of the Lens `productaffinity`, select `productaffinity-api` from the pod name search box.

With the above configuration, the setup will look like this:
