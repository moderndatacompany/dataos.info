Before setting up Lens 2 on your local system, ensure you meet the following requirements.

| **Dependency** | **Purpose** |
| --- | --- |
| **Docker** | Runs Lens 2.0 in an isolated environment on your local system. |
| **Docker Compose** | Configures and manages multi-container Docker applications for Lens 2.0. |
| **Postman App/Postman VSCode Extension** | Queries and tests Lens to ensure your setup functions correctly. |
| **VS Code** | Builds and manages Lens Model YAMLs as a code editor. |
| **VS Code Plugin (Optional)** | Enhances development experience by aiding in creating Lens 2.0 views and tables. |

### **Docker**

You need Docker to run Lens 2 in an isolated environment on your local system. This guide will help you install Docker if it's not already installed. If you have Docker installed, you can skip to the next step in your setup process.

**Checking for Existing Installation**

Before proceeding with the installation, check if Docker is already installed on your system by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
docker --version
```

If Docker is installed, you will see a version number like this:

```bash
Docker version 20.10.7, build f0df350
```

If Docker is not installed, follow the appropriate installation guide for your operating system:

- **Linux:** Follow the installation guide for the Docker engine for Linux here: [Install Docker on Linux](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/). It is recommended that you install the Docker Desktop version.
- **Windows:** Follow the installation guide of the Docker engine for Windows here: [Install Docker on Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/).
- **macOS:** Follow the installation guide of the Docker engine for Linux here: [Install Docker on macOS](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/).

**Docker Login**

Before you can pull or push images from your private repository, you have to log in to Docker Hub using the command line. You can use the docker login command to authenticate with Docker Hub using your Docker Hub username and password.

=== "Syntax"     

    ```bash
    docker login --username=${DOCKERHUB_USERNAME}
    ```


=== "Example"

    ```bash
    docker login --username=lensuser01
    ```

After executing the above command by replacing `${DOCKERHUB_USERNAME}`with the actual Docker hub username, it will ask for the password of your Docker account. 

```bash
docker login --lensuser01
Password:
 
#expected_output

WARNING! Your password will be stored unencrypted in /home/tomandjerry/.docker/config.json.
Configure a credential helper to remove this warning. See
https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/login/#credentials-store

Login Succeeded
```

<aside class="callout">
ðŸ’¡ For access to the username and password required to pull the Lens2 image, please contact the DataOS Administrator or Operator within your organization.
</aside>


**Pull the Image**

To pull the Docker image from a registry, use the Docker pull command. Docker will automatically pull the "latest" version of the image if no tag is specified. This command is necessary to fetch images from public or private registries.

=== "Syntax"

    ```bash
    docker pull [REGISTRY_HOST/]USERNAME/IMAGE[:TAG]
    ```

=== "Example"

    ```bash
    docker pull lensuser01/lens2:0.35.55-01    
    ```

<aside class=callout>
ðŸ’¡  Tags are used to identify specific versions of an image and can be updated over time. Make sure to pull the latest image tag or the tag defined in your docker-compose YAML.
</aside>

**Docker Compose**

Lens2 leverages Docker Compose for configuring multi-container Docker applications using a YAML file. This guide will walk you through the process of checking for an existing Docker Compose installation, installing it if necessary, and validating the installation.

**Checking for Existing Installation**

Before installing Docker Compose, itâ€™s a good idea to check if it's already installed on your system.
    
```bash
docker-compose --version
```
This command will return the version of Docker Compose installed, if any. For example:
    
``` bash
docker-compose version 1.29.2, build 5becea4c
```
    
**Installing Docker Compose**

If Docker Compose is not installed, refer to the following link to [install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

### **Visual Studio Code**

Lens2 includes a Visual Studio Code extension designed to enhance the efficiency and precision of crafting Lens2 YAML configurations. To leverage this extension, you must have Visual Studio Code (VS Code) installed on your local system. Below are the instructions and links for installing VS Code on different operating systems.

**Installation Links by Operating System**

- **Linux**: Follow the detailed steps to install VS Code on your Linux system by accessing the [Install VS Code on Linux guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/linux).
