# Workflow: First Steps

## Create a Workflow

A Workflow Resource instance can be deployed by applying the manifest file. But before creating a Workflow Resource, ensure you have required use-cases assigned.

### **Get Appropriate Access Permission Use Case**

In DataOS, different actions require specific use cases that grant the necessary permissions to execute a task. You can grant these use cases directly to a user or group them under a tag, which is then assigned to the user. The following table outlines various actions related to Workflow Resources and the corresponding use cases required:


| **Action** | **Required Use Cases** |
|------------|------------------------|
| Get        | Read Workspaces, Read Resources in User Specified Workspace / Read Resources in User Workspaces (for curriculum and sandbox workspaces) |
| Create     | Create and Update Resources in User Workspace       |
| Apply      | Create and Update Resources in User Workspace          |
| Delete     | Delete Resources in User Workspace               |
| Log        | Read Resource Logs in User Workspace                 |
            
To assign use cases, you can either contact the DataOS Operator or create a Grant Request by creating a Grant Resource. The request will be validated by the DataOS Operator.

### **Create a manifest file**

To create a Workflow Resource, data developers can define a set of attributes in a manifest file, typically in YAML format, and deploy it using the DataOS Command Line Interface (CLI) or API. Below is a sample manifest file for a Workflow Resource:

???tip "Sample Workflow manifest"

    ```yaml title="sample_workflow.yml"
    --8<-- "examples/resources/workflow/workflow.yml"
    ```

The manifest file for a Workflow Resource consists of three main sections, each requiring specific configuration:

- [Resource Meta Section](#resource-meta-section): Contains attributes shared among all types of Resources.
- [Workflow-specific Section](#workflow-specific-section): Includes attributes unique to the Workflow Resource.
- [Job-specific Section](#job-specific-section): Includes attributes unique to the Job.
- [Stack-Specific Section](#stack-specific-section): Encompasses attributes specific to the Stack orchestrated by the Workflow, which can vary depending on the Stack.

#### **Resource meta section**

In DataOS, a Workflow is categorized as a Resource type. The YAML configuration file for a Workflow Resource includes a Resource meta section, which contains attributes shared among all Resource types.

The following YAML excerpt illustrates the attributes specified within this section:

=== "Syntax"

      ```yaml
      name: ${{resource_name}} # Name of the Resource (mandatory)
      version: v1beta # Manifest version of the Resource (mandatory)
      type: workflow # Type of Resource (mandatory)
      tags: # Tags for categorizing the Resource (optional)
        - ${{tag_example_1}} 
        - ${{tag_example_2}} 
      description: ${{resource_description}} # Description (optional)
      owner: ${{resource_owner}} # Owner of the Resource (optional, default value: user-id of user deploying the resource)
      layer: ${{resource_layer}} # DataOS Layer (optional, default value: user)
      workflow: # Workflow-specific Section
        ${{Attributes of Workflow-specific Section}}
      ```
=== "Example"

      ```yaml
      name: my-first-workflow # Name of the Resource
      version: v1beta # Manifest version of the Resource
      type: workflow # Type of Resource
      tags: # Tags for categorizing the Resource
        - dataos:workflow 
        - workflow 
      description: Common attributes applicable to all DataOS Resources # Description
      owner: iamgroot # Owner of the Resource
      layer: user # DataOS Layer
      workflow: 
      ```

To configure a Workflow Resource, replace the values of `name`, `layer`, `tags`, `description`, and `owner` with appropriate values. For additional configuration information about the attributes of the Resource meta section, refer to the link: [Attributes of Resource meta section](/resources/manifest_attributes/).

#### **Workflow-specific section**

The Workflow-specific sectionThe Workflow-specific section contains configurations specific to the Workflow Resource. DataOS supports two types of Workflows: [single-run](/resources/workflow/how_to_guide/single_run_workflow/) and [scheduled](/resources/workflow/how_to_guide/scheduled_workflow/) Workflow, each with its own YAML syntax. of a manifest file encompasses attributes specific to the Workflow Resource.

**Single-Run Workflow YAML configuration**

A Single-run Workflow executes only once. It does not include a schedule section. The YAML configuration for a single-run Workflow is as follows:

```yaml
workflow:
  dag:
    ${{list-of-jobs}}
```
<center><i>Workflow-specific Section configuration for Single-run Workflow</i></center>

**Scheduled Workflow YAML configuration**

A Scheduled Workflow triggers a series of jobs or tasks at particular intervals or predetermined times. To create a scheduled Workflow, specify the [attributes](/resources/workflow/configurations/) in the [`schedule`](/resources/workflow/configurations/#schedule) section, in the following format:
```yaml
workflow:
  schedule:
    cron: ${{'/10 * * * *'}}
  dag:
    ${{list-of-jobs}}
```
<center><i>Workflow-specific section configuration for Scheduled Workflow</i></center>

#### **Job-specific Section**

A [Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)](/resources/workflow/core_concepts/#workflow-and-directed-acyclic-graph-dag) represents the sequence and dependencies between various jobs within the Workflow. A DAG must contain at least one job.

**Job**

A Job denotes a single processing task. Multiple jobs within a DAG can be linked sequentially or concurrently to achieve a specific result through [`dependencies`](/resources/workflow/configurations/#dependencies). Here is an example YAML syntax for two jobs linked by dependencies:
```yaml
dag: 
  - name: ${{job1 name}}
    spec: 
      stack: ${{stack1:version}}
      compute: ${{compute name}}
      resources:
        requests:
          cpu: ${{requested cpu}}
          memory: ${{requested memory}}
        limits:
          cpu: ${{cpu limits}}
          memory: ${{memory limits}}
      stack1: 
        ${{stack1 specific attributes}}
  - name: ${{job2-name}}
    spec: 
      stack: ${{stack2:version}}
      compute: ${{compute name}}
      stack2: 
        ${{stack2 specific configuration}}
    dependencies: 
      - ${{job1-name}}
```
<center><i>Job-specific section YAML configuration</i></center>

Further, jobs can be retried automatically by pre-defining the retry strategy within the Workflow YAML. This could be helpful in case of job failures or unexpected errors. Learn about job retries by navigating to the following link: [How to retry failed jobs within a Workflow?](/resources/workflow/how_to_guide/retry_jobs/)

<aside class=callout>

üó£Ô∏è Please be aware that the code block above outlines only the general configuration for a job. The actual attributes may differ based on the specific <a href="/resources/stacks/">Stack</a> utilized within a job.

</aside>

#### **Stack-specific Section**

The Stack-specific Section allows you to specify the desired [Stack](/resources/stacks/) for executing your Workflow. Depending on your requirements, you can choose from the following supported Stacks:

- [Flare Stack](/resources/stacks/flare/): The Flare stack provides advanced capabilities for data processing and analysis.

- [Container Stack](/resources/stacks/container/): The Container stack offers a powerful environment for hosting web-application, and custom Docker images atop DataOS.

- [Scanner Stack](/resources/stacks/scanner/): The Scanner Stack provides metadata ingestion capabilities from a source.

For more detailed instructions on setting up and customizing the Stack-specific Section attributes according to your needs, refer to the respective documentation of [Flare](/resources/stacks/flare/configurations/), [Container](/resources/stacks/container/#container-stack-section), [Scanner](/resources/stacks/scanner/) Stack. Each Stack has its unique attributes that can enhance the functionality of your job.

                  - name: output01 # step name
                    sql: SELECT * FROM city_connect
```

</details>

## Apply the Workflow YAML

Once you have constructed the Workflow YAML file, it's time to [apply](/resources/#apply) it and create the Workflow [Resource](/resources/) within the DataOS environment. Use the following [`apply`](/interfaces/cli/command_reference/#apply) 

=== "Command"

    ```bash
    dataos-ctl apply -f ${{yaml file path}} -w ${{workspace}}
    ```
===  "Example"

    ```bash
    dataos-ctl apply -f home/iamgroot/resource/workflow.yml -w curriculum
    ```

Workspace specification is optional. In case its not provided the Workflow runs in the `curriculum` Workspace. To create a new Workspace, execute the [`workspace create`](/interfaces/cli/command_reference/#workspace) command as shown below and then execute the above command:

=== "Command"

    ```bash
    dataos-ctl workspace create -n ${{name of your workspace}}
    ```

===  "Example"

    ```bash
    dataos-ctl workspace create -n new_workspace
    ```

## How to Monitor a Workflow?

### **Get Status of the Workflow**

To retrieve information about the Workflow, use the [`get`](/interfaces/cli/command_reference/#get) command in the [CLI](/interfaces/cli/). The command below lists workflows created by the user in a specific Workspace. 

=== "Command"

    ```bash
    dataos-ctl get -t ${workflow} -w ${curriculum}
    ```
=== "Example"

    ```bash
    dataos-ctl get -t workflow -w curriculum
    #expected_output
    INFO[0000] üîç get...
    INFO[0001] üîç get...complete

              NAME        | VERSION |   TYPE   | WORKSPACE | STATUS | RUNTIME |   OWNER
    ----------------------|---------|----------|-----------|--------|---------|-------------
      cnt-product-demo-01 | v1      | workflow | curriculum    | active | running |   tmdc
    ```


To check this information for all users in a specific Workspace, add the `-a` flag to the command as shown below.


```bash
dataos-ctl get -t workflow -w curriculum -a
#expected_output
INFO[0000] üîç get...
INFO[0001] üîç get...complete

          NAME           | VERSION |   TYPE   | WORKSPACE | STATUS |  RUNTIME  |       OWNER
-------------------------|---------|----------|-----------|--------|-----------|--------------------
  checks-sports-data     | v1      | workflow | curriculum    | active | succeeded | user01
  cnt-product-demo-01    | v1      | workflow | curriculum    | active | running   | tmdc
  cnt-product-demo-01-01 | v1      | workflow | curriculum    | active | succeeded | otheruser
  cnt-city-demo-01001    | v1      | workflow | curriculum    | active | succeeded | user03
```

### **Get Runtime Information**

To obtain the runtime status of the Workflow, use the [`get runtime`](/interfaces/cli/command_reference/#runtime) 


=== "Command"

    ```bash
    dataos-ctl get runtime -w ${{workspace-name}} -t workflow -n ${{name of workflow}}
    ```

=== "Example"

    ```bash
    dataos-ctl get runtime -w curriculum -t workflow -n cnt-product-demo-01
    ```

Alternatively, you can extract the Workflow information from the output of the [`get`](/interfaces/cli/command_reference/#get) command and pass it as a string to the [`get runtime`](/interfaces/cli/command_reference/#runtime) command. Look for the relevant information (highlighted) in the [`get`](/interfaces/cli/command_reference/#get) command output:

=== "Command"

    ```bash
    dataos-ctl get -t workflow -w ${curriculum}
    ```

=== "Example"

    ```bash
    dataos-ctl get -t workflow -w curriculum
    # the output is shown below
              NAME        | VERSION |   TYPE   | WORKSPACE | STATUS | RUNTIME |   OWNER     
    ----------------------|---------|----------|-----------|--------|---------|-------------
      cnt-product-demo-01 | v1      | workflow | curriculum    | active | running |   tmdc
    ```

Select the workflow details from Name to Workspace tab, for example, `cnt-product-demo-01 | v1 | workflow | curriculum`.


```bash
dataos-ctl get runtime -i "cnt-product-demo-01 | v1 | workflow | curriculum"
```

```
</details>

### **Get Runtime Refresh**

To refresh or see updates on the Workflow progress, add the `-r` flag to the [`get runtime`](/interfaces/cli/command_reference/#runtime) command:

```bash
dataos-ctl -i get runtime " cnt-product-demo-01 | v1 | workflow | curriculum" -r
```

Press `Ctrl + C` to exit.

For any additional flags, use help by appending `-h` with the respective command.

## How to troubleshoot Workflow errors?

### **Check Logs for Errors**

To check the logs for errors, retrieve the node name from the output of the `get runtime` command for the failed node, as shown [here](/interfaces/cli/command_reference/#runtime), and execute the command as shown below

=== "Command"

    ```bash
    dataos-ctl -i "${{copy the name to workspace in the output table from get command}}" --node ${{failed node name from get runtime command}} log
    ```

=== "Example"

    ```bash
    dataos-ctl -i " cnt-product-demo-01 | v1 | workflow | curriculum" --node city-001-c5dq-0624114155-driver log
    ```

You will notice an error message: "*There is an existing job with the same workspace. You should use a different job name for your job as you cannot change output datasets for any job.*"

### **Fix the Errors**

Modify the YAML configuration by changing the name of the Workflow. For example, rename it from `cnt-product-demo-01` to `cnt-city-demo-999`.

### **Delete the Previous Workflow**

Before re-running the Workflow, delete the previous version from the environment. There are three ways to delete the Workflow as shown below.

=== "Method1"

    Copy the name to Workspace from the output table of the [`get`](/interfaces/cli/command_reference/#get) command and use it as a string in the delete command.

    === "Command"

        ```bash
        dataos-ctl delete -i "${{name to workspace in the output table from get status command}}"
        ```

    === "Example"

        ```bash
        dataos-ctl delete -i "cnt-product-demo-01 | v1 | workflow | curriculum"
        #Expected_Output
        INFO[0000] üóë delete...
        INFO[0001] üóë deleting(curriculum) cnt-product-demo-01:v1:workflow...
        INFO[0003] üóë deleting(curriculum) cnt-product-demo-01:v1:workflow...deleted
        INFO[0003] üóë delete...complete
        ```

=== "Method 2"

    Specify the path of the YAML file and use the [`delete`](/interfaces/cli/command_reference/#delete) command.

    ===  "Command"

        ```bash
        dataos-ctl delete -f ${{file-path}}
        ```

    === "Example"

        ```bash
        dataos-ctl delete -f /home/desktop/flare/connect-city/config_v1.yaml
        #expected_output
        INFO[0000] üóë delete...
        INFO[0000] üóë deleting(curriculum) cnt-city-demo-010:v1:workflow...
        INFO[0001] üóë deleting(curriculum) cnt-city-demo-010:v1:workflow...deleted
        INFO[0001] üóë delete...complete
        ```

=== "Method 3" 

    Specify the Workspace, Resource-type, and Workflow name in the [`delete`](/interfaces/cli/command_reference/#delete) command.

    === "Command"

        ```bash
        dataos-ctl delete -w ${{workspace}} -t workflow -n ${{workflow name}}
        ```

    === "Example"

        ```bash
        dataos-ctl delete -w curriculum -t workflow -n cnt-product-demo-01
        #expected_output
        INFO[0000] üóë delete...
        INFO[0000] üóë deleting(curriculum) cnt-city-demo-010:v1:workflow...
        INFO[0001] üóë deleting(curriculum) cnt-city-demo-010:v1:workflow...deleted
        INFO[0001] üóë delete...complete
        ```

### **Rerun the Workflow**

Run the Workflow again using the [`apply`](/interfaces/cli/command_reference/#apply) command. 

Command:

```bash
dataos-ctl apply -f ${{file path}} -w ${{workspace}}
```
Once you have applied the Workflow, check the runtime for its success by using the [`get runtime`](/interfaces/cli/command_reference/#runtime) command

=== "Command"

    ```bash
    dataos-ctl get runtime -i "${{copy the name to workspace in the output table from get status command}}" -r
    ```

=== "Example"

    ```bash
    dataos-ctl -i "cnt-city-demo-999 | v1 | workflow | curriculum" get runtime -r
    ```
