# Core Concepts

## Terms

### **Metric**

A quantifiable occurrence used to track and assess the status or performance of specific aspects of a system, process, or business function. These are objective, numerical data points that are collected and analyzed to identify trends, patterns, or deviations from expected norms. For example,

- Average CPU Utilization: Average percentage of CPU usage over a day/month/year.
- Customer Churn Rate: Percentage of customers lost in the past year.

### **Event**

A qualifiable occurrence within a system or process that reflects a specific change, action, anomaly, etc. Unlike metrics, which are quantitative measures, events are discrete and qualitative. They can range from system-generated alerts, such as errors or status changes, to user-initiated actions, like deployments or configuration changes. For example,

- Data Pipeline Failure: A data processing pipeline encounters an error, halting data flow.
- Schema Change in Data Source: A modification is detected in the schema of a source database.

### **Condition**

A user-defined criterion or a set of criteria that must be satisfied by a metric or event for an incident to be generated. For example,

- Average CPU Utilization (*metric*) exceeds 85% (*condition*).
- IoT device reports (*event*) connectivity 'loss' (*condition*).

### **Incident**

Output generated by the Monitor when a predefined *condition*, based on *metrics* or *events*, is met. For example,

- Output generated when either the *Average CPU Utilization* (metric) exceeds the predefined condition or an *Error 500* occurs (event), indicating a performance issue or critical failure, respectively.

## Architecture

The Monitor Service has two major components - Monitor DB and Scheduler. Monitor DB stores the manifest file of each instance of Monitor in its database. The Scheduler reads from this manifest file to query the Metric & Event store. This Metric & Event store is a proxy for any storage system, such as an SQL database, Prometheus DB, a streaming DB or a queryable source of choice.

Monitor Service is responsible for cross-checking the [condition](/resources/monitor/#key-concepts-of-monitor) declared by the user with an Event/Metric generated in the system. If the condition is fulfilled, it publishes the information mentioned in the manifest file as an [incident](/resources/monitor/#key-concepts-of-monitor) to a [Fastbase](/resources/depot/fastbase/) topic. This Fastbase topic is a store based on the Pulsar DB system.
