# Steps to create a streaming Monitor

Follow the below steps to create a streaming Monitor:

## Pre-requisites

Before creating a streaming Monitor, the following prerequisites must be met for creating a Monitor in DataOS.

**Logged into DataOS CLI:**

Ensure that the DataOS Command Line Interface is set up on the local system and that the user is logged in before proceeding. See Setting up CLI.

**Permissions:**

Verify that the appropriate permissions are available to create and manage a Monitor.

Once the prerequisites are satisfied, Monitor Resources in DataOS can be created.


## Step 1: Create a manifest file of a Monitor

Copy and edit the manifest file below to create a streaming Monitor for Workflow runtime failure. Replace the provided Workflow name with the actual Workflow name. To observe the status instead of runtime, replace `runtime` with `status` in `dataOsInatnace.path`.

=== "Manifest"

    ```yaml
    name: ${{monitor-name}}
    version: v1beta
    type: worker
    tags:
      - pod
      - stream
      - monitor
    description: ${{Add a short description}}
    worker:
      stack: stream-monitor
      compute: ${{compute-name}}
      replicas: 1
      resources:
        requests:
          cpu: 100m
          memory: 100Mi
        limits:
          cpu: 200m
          memory: 200Mi
      stackSpec:
        type: stream_monitor
        incident:
          type: ${{incident-type}}
          name: ${{incident-name}}
          summary: ${{incident-summary}}
          category: stream
          severity: ${{severity, e.g., warning}}
        stream:
          source:
            fastbase:
              topic: ${{fastbase_topic, e.g., persistent://system/poros/pods}}
              maxWorkers: 100
              subscriptionName: ${{pods-stream-monitor-125-001}}
              subscriptionPosition: ${{latest}}
          conditions:
            - valueJqFilter: ${{condition-1-filter}}       # e.g., '.producer_name'
              operator: ${{condition-1-operator}}          # e.g., equals
              value: ${{condition-1-value}}                # e.g., 'poros-recorder-1-hub'
            - valueJqFilter: ${{condition-2-filter}}       # e.g., '.properties.dataplane'
              operator: ${{condition-2-operator}}          # e.g., equals
              value: ${{condition-2-value}}                # e.g., 'hub'
            - valueJqFilter: ${{condition-3-filter}}       # e.g., '.key'
              operator: ${{condition-3-operator}}          # e.g., contains
              value: ${{condition-3-value}}                # e.g., 'delete:pods:juicefs'
    ```

=== "Example"

    ```yaml
    name: pods-stream-monitor
    version: v1beta
    type: worker
    tags:
      - pod
      - stream
      - monitor

          cpu: 100m
          memory: 100Mi
        limits:

          memory: 200Mi
      stackSpec:

        incident:
          type: pulsar
          name: stream-monitor-incident
          summary: 'stream monitor incident, found a specific pod'
          category: stream
          severity: warning
        stream:
          source:
            fastbase:
              topic: persistent://system/poros/pods
              maxWorkers: 100
              subscriptionName: pods-stream-monitor-125-001
              subscriptionPosition: latest
          conditions:
            - valueJqFilter: '.producer_name'
              operator: equals
              value: 'poros-recorder-1-hub'
            - valueJqFilter: '.properties.dataplane'
              operator: equals
              value: 'hub'
            - valueJqFilter: '.key'
              operator: contains
              value: 'delete:pods:juicefs'
    ```


**Possible values for `runtime` and `status`**

| Attribute | Description | Common Values |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| `runtime` | Indicates the execution state or duration of a Resource. | `running`, `succeeded`, `failed`, (or a specific time duration, e.g., `5m`, `1h`) |
| `status`  | Represents the operational status of a Resource. | `active`, `error`, `deleted` |


**Attributes description:**


| Attribute | Description |
|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| monitor.report.source.dataOsInstance.path | API path to the report data source to be monitored. |
| monitor.report.conditions | List of conditions to evaluate against the report data. |
| monitor.report.conditions[].valueComparison.observationType | The type of observation to check (e.g., runtime, status). |
| monitor.report.conditions[].valueComparison.valueJqFilter | JQ filter to extract the value from the report data (e.g., '.value'). |
| monitor.report.conditions[].valueComparison.operator | Operator used for comparison (e.g., equals, less_than, greater_than). |
| monitor.report.conditions[].valueComparison.value | The value to compare against (e.g., failed). |

To know more about each attributes, please refer to the [configuration section](/resources/monitor/configurations/).



## Step 2: Apply the Monitor manifest through CLI

Once the Monitor manifest file is created, it must be applied within the DataOS environment to create the Monitor Resource. This can be accomplished using the Command Line Interface (CLI) with the following commands:

```bash
dataos-ctl resource apply -f ${manifest-file-path} -w ${workspace-name}
```

Alternatively, this task can also be accomplished using a simpler command. Both commands are equivalent, and either one can be used depending on preference:

```bash
dataos-ctl apply -f ${manifest-file-path} -w ${workspace-name}
```

**Example:**

Below is an example of how to apply a Monitor manifest file located at `/home/monitor/incident-monitor.yml` to the `curriculum` workspace:

```bash
dataos-ctl resource apply -f /home/monitor/incident-monitor.yml -w curriculum
```

**Expected output:**

After running the command, an output similar to the following should be displayed, indicating that the Monitor Resource instance has been applied.

```bash
# Expected Output
INFO[0000] üîç apply...                                     
INFO[0001] üîç applying(curriculum) cpu-usage-spike:v1alpha:monitor...
INFO[0002] üîç applying(curriculum) cpu-usage-spike:v1alpha:monitor...created                                     
INFO[0003] üîç apply...complete
```

## Step 3: Verify Monitor status

The following command is used to check the current states of the Monitor Resource to verify that Monitor is configured properly.

=== "Command"

    ```bash
    dataos-ctl resource get -t Monitor -w ${{workspace name}} -n ${{monitor-name}} -r
    ```

=== "Example usage"

    ```bash
    dataos-ctl resource get -t Monitor -w curriculum -n runtime-monitor1 -r

    # Expected output               
    INFO[0000] üîç get...                                     
    INFO[0001] üîç get...complete                             

            NAME       | VERSION |  TYPE   | WORKSPACE | STATUS |            RUNTIME             |    OWNER     
    -------------------|---------|---------|-----------|--------|--------------------------------|--------------
      runtime-monitor1 | v1alpha | Monitor | curriculum    | active | next:2025-07-28T13:40:00+05:30 | iamgroot

    ```

Details of any created Monitor can also be accessed through the DataOS GUI in the [Metis catalog](/interfaces/metis/) and [Operations App](/interfaces/operations/).

      <img src="/resources/monitor/report_ops.png" alt="Operations App" style="border:1px solid black; width: 100%; height: auto;">
      <figcaption><i>Operations App</i></figcaption>
    </div>

=== "Metis Catalog"

    </div>

## **Next steps**

After successfully creating the Report Monitor for Workflow runtime failure, the next step is to configure a [Pager Resource](/resources/pager/). The Pager Resource is responsible for sending alerts to configured Teams channels or email addresses whenever the incident condition is met.
