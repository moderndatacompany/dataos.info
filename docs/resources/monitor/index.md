# :resources-monitor: Monitor

The Monitor [Resource](/resources/) is an integral part of DataOSâ€™ Observability system, designed to trigger incidents based on specific [events](/resources/) or metrics. By leveraging the Monitor Resource alongside the [Pager](/resources/pager/) Resource for sending alerts, DataOS users can achieve comprehensive observability and proactive incident management, ensuring high system reliability and performance. To understand the key concepts associated with a Monitor, refer to the following link: [Core Concepts](/resources/monitor/core_concepts/).
