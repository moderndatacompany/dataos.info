# Steps to create Amazon S3 Depot

## Pre-requisites specific to Depot creation

- **Tags:** A developer must possess the following tags, which can be obtained from a DataOS operator.

    ```bash
            NAME     │     ID      │  TYPE  │        EMAIL         │              TAGS               
        ─────────────┼─────────────┼────────┼──────────────────────┼─────────────────────────────────
        Iamgroot     │   iamgroot  │ person │   iamgroot@tmdc.io   │ roles:id:data-dev,                            
                     │             │        │                      │ roles:id:user,                  
                     │             │        │                      │ users:id:iamgroot  
    ```

- **Use cases:** Alternatively, instead of assigning tags, a developer can create a Depot if an operator grants them the "Manage All Instance-level Resources of DataOS in the user layer" use case through Bifrost Governance.

## Pre-requisites specific to the S3 Depot

To create a S3 Depot you must have the following details:

- **AWS access key ID**: The Access Key ID used to authenticate and authorize API requests to your AWS account. This can be obtained from the AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management) Console under your user’s security credentials or requested from your AWS administrator.

- **AWS bucket name**: The name of the Amazon S3 bucket where the data resides. You can find this in the AWS S3 Console under the list of buckets or request it from the administrator managing the storage.

- **Secret access key**: The Secret Access Key associated with your AWS Access Key ID, is required for secure API requests. This is available in the AWS IAM Console under your user’s security credentials. Ensure that it is securely stored and shared only with authorized personnel.

- **Scheme**: The scheme specifies the protocol to be used for the connection, such as `s3` or `https`. This information depends on your system’s configuration and can be confirmed with the team managing the connection setup or workflow.

- **Relative Path**: The path within the S3 bucket that points to the specific data or folder you want to access. This path is typically structured according to how your data is organized and can be obtained from the team managing the data or the AWS S3 Console.

- **Format**: The file format of the data stored in the S3 bucket, such as `CSV`, `Parquet`, or `JSON`. This information is determined by the structure of your data and can be confirmed with the team managing the data storage.

## Create a S3 Depot

Azure Blob File System Secure (ABFSS) is an object storage system. Object stores are distributed storage systems designed to store and manage large amounts of unstructured data.

DataOS enables the creation of a Depot of type 'Bigquery' to facilitate the reading of data stored in an Azure Blob Storage account. This Depot provides access to the storage account, which can consist of multiple containers. A container serves as a grouping mechanism for multiple blobs. It is recommended to define a separate Depot for each container. To create a Depot of type ‘ABFSS‘, follow the below steps:

### **Step 1: Create an Instance Secret for securing S3 credentials**

Begin by creating an Instance Secret Resource by following the [Instance Secret document](/resources/instance_secret/).

### **Step 2: Create a S3 Depot manifest file**

Begin by creating a manifest file to hold the configuration details for your S3 Depot.


```yaml 
name: ${{depot-name}}
version: v2alpha
type: depot
tags:
    - ${{tag1}}
owner: ${{owner-name}}
layer: user
description: ${{description}}
depot:
    type: S3                                          
    external: ${{true}}
    s3:                                            
    scheme: ${{s3a}}
    bucket: ${{project-name}}
    relativePath: ${{relative-path}}
    format: ${{format}}
    secrets:
    - name: ${{s3-instance-secret-name}}-r
        allkeys: true

    - name: ${{s3-instance-secret-name}}-rw
        allkeys: true
```


To get the details of each attribute, please refer [to this link](/resources/depot/configurations).
   


### **Step 3: Apply the Depot manifest file**

Once you have the manifest file ready in your code editor, simply copy the path of the manifest file and apply it through the DataOS CLI by pasting the path in the placeholder, using the command given below:

=== "Command"

    ```bash
    dataos-ctl resource apply -f ${{yamlfilepath}}
    ```
=== "Alternative Command"

    ```bash
    dataos-ctl apply -f ${{yamlfilepath}}
    ```



### **Verify the Depot creation**

To ensure that your Depot has been successfully created, you can verify it in two ways:

- Check the name of the newly created Depot in the list of Depots where you are named as the owner:

    ```bash
    dataos-ctl get -t depot
    ```

- Additionally, retrieve the list of all Depots created in your organization:

    ```bash
    dataos-ctl get -t depot -a
    ```

You can also access the details of any created Depot through the DataOS GUI in the [Operations App](https://dataos.info/interfaces/operations/) and [Metis UI](https://dataos.info/interfaces/metis/).

## Delete a Depot

<aside class="callout">
🗣️ As part of best practices, it is recommended to regularly delete Resources that are no longer in use. This practice offers several benefits, including saving time and reducing costs.
</callout>

If you need to delete a Depot, use the following command in the DataOS CLI:

=== "Command"

    ```bash
    dataos-ctl delete -t depot -n ${{name of Depot}}
    ```
=== "Alternative Command"

    ```bash
    dataos-ctl delete -f ${{path of your manifest file}}
    ```



By executing the above command, the specified Depot will be deleted from your DataOS environment.

## Limit the data source's file format

Another important function that a Depot can play is to limit the file type that can read from and write to a particular data source. In the `spec` section of the config file, simply mention the `format` of the files you want to allow access to.

```yaml
depot:
  type: S3
  description: ${{description}}
  external: true
  S3:
    scheme: ${{s3a}}
    bucket: ${{bucket-name}}
    relativePath: "raw" 
    format: ${{format}}  # mention the file format, such as JSON
```

For file-based systems, if you define the format as ‘Iceberg’, you can choose the meta-store catalog between Hadoop and Hive. This is how you do it:

```yaml
depot:
  type: ABFSS
  description: "ABFSS Iceberg Depot for sanity"
  compute: runnable-default
  S3:
    account: 
    container: 
    relativePath:
    format: ICEBERG
    endpointSuffix:
    icebergCatalogType: Hive
```
