# Steps to create Kafka Depot
To create a Kafka Depot you must have the following details:

## Pre-requisites specific to Depot creation

- **Tags:** A developer must possess the following tags, which can be obtained from a DataOS operator.

    ```bash
            NAME     │     ID      │  TYPE  │        EMAIL         │              TAGS               
        ─────────────┼─────────────┼────────┼──────────────────────┼─────────────────────────────────
        Iamgroot     │   iamgroot  │ person │   iamgroot@tmdc.io   │ roles:id:data-dev,                            
                     │             │        │                      │ roles:id:user,                  
                     │             │        │                      │ users:id:iamgroot  
    ```

- **Use cases:** Alternatively, instead of assigning tags, a developer can create a Depot if an operator grants them the "Manage All Instance-level Resources of DataOS in the user layer" use case through Bifrost Governance.

## Pre-requisites specific to the source system

- **KAFKA Broker List**: A comma-separated list of broker addresses in the Kafka cluster (e.g., `broker1:9092,broker2:9092`). The broker list allows the connection to discover all topics and partitions in the cluster. This information can be obtained from the Kafka admin or the cluster configuration file, usually found in the `server.properties` file.

- **Schema Registry URL**: The URL of the Schema Registry associated with your Kafka cluster, which stores the schemas for the data being produced and consumed. This is required if your Kafka topics use Avro or other schema-based serialization formats. You can obtain this URL from the Kafka admin or the configuration details of the Schema Registry setup.

## Create a Kafka Depot

DataOS allows you to create a Depot of type 'KAFKA' to read live topic data. This Depot enables you to access and consume real-time streaming data from Kafka. To create a Depot of type 'KAFKA', follow the below steps:

### **Step 1: Create an Instance Secret for securing Kafka credentials**

Begin by creating an Instance Secret Resource by following the [Instance Secret document](/resources/instance_secret/data_sources/kafka/).

### **Step 2: Create a Kafka Depot manifest file**

Begin by creating a manifest file to hold the configuration details for your Kafka Depot.


```yaml
name: ${{depot-name}}
version: v1
type: depot
description: {{description}}
tags:
  - ${{tag1}}
owner: ${{owner-name}}
layer: user
depot:
  type: KAFKA
  kafka:
    brokers:
      -  {{broker1}}
  secret:
    - name: ${{kafka-instance-secret-name}}-r
      allkeys: true

 
```
To get the details of each attribute, please refer [to this link](/resources/depot/configurations).

### **Step 3: Apply the Depot manifest file**

Once you have the manifest file ready in your code editor, simply copy the path of the manifest file and apply it through the DataOS CLI by pasting the path in the placeholder, using the command given below:

=== "Command"

    ```bash
    dataos-ctl resource apply -f ${{yamlfilepath}}
    ```

=== "Alternative Command"

    ```bash
    dataos-ctl apply -f ${{yamlfilepath}}
    ```



## Verify the Depot creation

To ensure that your Depot has been successfully created, you can verify it in two ways:

- Check the name of the newly created Depot in the list of Depots where you are named as the owner:

    ```bash
    dataos-ctl get -t depot
    ```

- Additionally, retrieve the list of all Depots created in your organization:

    ```bash
    dataos-ctl get -t depot -a
    ```

You can also access the details of any created Depot through the DataOS GUI in the [Operations App](/interfaces/operations/) and [Metis UI](/interfaces/metis/).

## Delete a Depot

<aside class="callout">
🗣️ As part of best practices, it is recommended to regularly delete Resources that are no longer in use. This practice offers several benefits, including saving time and reducing costs.
</aside>

If you need to delete a Depot, use the following command in the DataOS CLI:

=== "Command"

    ```bash 
    dataos-ctl delete -t depot -n ${{name of Depot}}
    ```

=== "Alternative Command"

    ```bash 
    dataos-ctl delete -f ${{path of your manifest file}}
    ```


By executing the above command, the specified Depot will be deleted from your DataOS environment.
