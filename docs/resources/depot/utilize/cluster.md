# Query the source

For better understanding of the data, a user can query the data directly on Workbench without moving the data by creating a [Cluster Resource](/resources/cluster/).

**For example:**

A user wants to query data from the `bqdepot` Depot on Workbench, so they create a Cluster named `minervabq` targeting `bqdepot.`The below manifest file defines a Minerva-based Cluster Resource, `minervabq`, for querying data within DataOS. It specifies a `query-default` compute environment and configures Minerva-specific settings, including a single replica with resource allocations of 2 CPU cores (2000m) and 4Gi memory for both limits and requests. Debug settings define `INFO` log level for general logs and `ERROR` for Trino logs, ensuring controlled verbosity. The Cluster is linked to a Depot at `dataos://depotbq`, allowing seamless access to data stored in that location for querying and processing.
