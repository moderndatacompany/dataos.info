# Accelerating queries

For enhancing the query performance, a user can cache the data using [Flash Stack.](/resources/stacks/flash/)

**For example:**

A user wants to reduce the time it takes to get query results, so they cache the dataset in the lakehouse Depot using Flash Service. This ensures faster query results whenever the dataset is queried. The below manifest file defines a Service named `flashtest`. The Service caches a dataset named `city`, stored in `dataos://lakehouse:retail/city`, and initializes a table `mycity` by selecting data from `retail.city`.
