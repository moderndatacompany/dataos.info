# Building semantic models

A semantic model can be build using Depot as a source. To learn more about this please [refer to this link](/resources/lens/data_sources/snowflake/) on creating a semantic model using  a Snowflake Depot. You can build a semantic model on Redshift, Bigquery, Postgres, Snowflake, and Lakehouse type of Depots. To create a semantic model on other types of Depots one must ingest data to DataOS Lakehouse using [Flare Stack](/resources/stacks/flare/).
