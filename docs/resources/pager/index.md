# :resources-pager: Pager

A Pager in DataOS is a [Resource](/resources/) that enables data developers to specify criteria for identifying an incident within the incident stream and delivering it to a user-specified destination. It operates by evaluating pre-defined conditions against incoming incident data from the incident stream. Upon identifying a match, it triggers an alert and delivers it to the specified destination.

<!-- **But why two Resources, Monitor and Pagers, why not combine it into one?**

Having the Pager and Monitor Resources, separate enables data developers to leverage the existing mechanisms. The ideology of DataOS is not to rip and replace but start leveraging the existing resources. Organizations can start leveraging their existing alerting systems like Pager Duty in combination with DataOS Monitors. -->


## Supported alerting channels

Pager Resource can send alerts to the following channels:

- **Microsoft Teams channel**: Send alerts directly to Teams channels using webhook integration.

- **Email**: Supports all major email providers including Gmail, Outlook, and others.

- **Any channel with webhook support**: Integrate with Slack, custom applications, or other platforms that accept webhook payloads.

Users can configure Pager to send alerts to all supported channels at once, or to any individual channel, depending on the preference and requirements.

The Pager along with [Monitor](/resources/monitor/) Resource comprise the backbone of the DataOS Observability and enable alerting mechanism in response to specified incident conditions.


## How to create a Pager Resource?

To create a Pager Resource in DataOS, follow the step-by-step instructions provided here: [First steps](/resources/pager/create_pager/). This section covers the prerequisites, manifest file structure, and the commands required to create and apply a Pager Resource.

## How does a Pager work?

A Pager within DataOS operates by continuously monitoring the incident stream for occurrences that match predefined criteria, known as conditions. Here's a breakdown of how a Pager functions:

1. **Condition evaluation:** The Pager evaluates incoming incident data against the conditions specified in its manifest file. These conditions typically include attributes like severity, type, name of the incident, etc.

2. **Matching criteria:** When an incident matches all specified conditions, the Pager identifies it as a trigger for an alert. This matching process ensures that only relevant incidents initiate alert notifications.

3. **Alert triggering:** Upon identifying a matching incident, the Pager triggers an alert, notifying designated recipients or systems about the occurrence. The alert can be sent to various destinations such as email, Microsoft Teams, or custom webhooks.

4. **Destination delivery:** Depending on the configuration, the alert is delivered to the specified destination. For example, if the Pager is configured to send alerts via email, it will generate an email containing details of the incident and send it to the designated email addresses.

## How to delete a Pager?

To remove a specific Pager Resource-instance from the DataOS environment, you can use the `delete` command. There are three methods to delete a Pager:

**Method 1: Delete by identifier**

- Copy the name of the Pager from the output table of the `get` command.

    ```bash
    dataos-ctl get -t pager -w public -n pager-test   
    INFO[0000] üîç get...                                     
    INFO[0001] üîç get...complete                             

            NAME       | VERSION | TYPE  | WORKSPACE | STATUS | RUNTIME |    OWNER     
    -------------------|---------|-------|-----------|--------|---------|--------------
        pager-test    | v1alpha | pager | public    | active | running | iamgroot 
    ```

- Use the name as a string in the delete command.

    === "Command"
      
        ```bash
        dataos-ctl delete -i "${name to workspace in the output table from get command}"
        ```

    === "Example"

        ```bash
        dataos-ctl delete -i "pager-alert | v1alpha | pager | public"
        ```

**Method 2: Delete by manifest file path**

- Copy the path of the manifest file containing Pager configuration.

- Use the `delete` command with the `-f` flag.

    === "Command"

        ```bash
        dataos-ctl delete -f ${file-path}
        ```

    === "Example"

        ```bash
        dataos-ctl delete -f /home/pager/v1alpha.yaml
        ```

**Method 3: Delete by workspace, Resource-type, and name**

Specify the Workspace, Resource-type, and Pager name in the `delete` command.

=== "Command"

    ```bash
    dataos-ctl delete -w ${workspace-name} -t pager -n ${pager-name}
    ```

=== "Example"

    ```bash
    dataos-ctl delete -w sandbox -t pager -n pager-alert
    ```

After executing the delete command, you will receive a confirmation message indicating successful deletion of the Pager.

## Configurations

The Pager manifest file serves as the blueprint for defining the structure and behavior of Pager Resources within DataOS. By configuring various attributes within the the Pager manifest file, data developers can customize the functionality of their Pagers to meet specific requirements. Below is an overview of the key attributes used to configure a the Pager-specific section: [Attributes of a Pager manifest](/resources/pager/configurations/). 

For details about the Resource meta section, refer to the [Attributes of Resource meta section](/resources/manifest_attributes/)

## Troubleshooting

When a Pager encounters errors, data developers can employ various tactics to diagnose and resolve issues effectively. Here are the recommended debugging techniques:

- **Get Pager details**

    - Retrieve detailed information about the Pager to gain deeper insights into its configuration and execution status. This can be accomplished using the following command:

        === "Command"
            ```bash
            dataos-ctl resource get -t pager -w ${workspace-name} -n ${pager-name} -d
            ```
        === "Example"
            ```bash
            dataos-ctl get -t pager -w public -n pager-test -d

            # output:
            INFO[0000] üîç get...                                     
            INFO[0000] üîç get...complete

    - Review the output to identify any discrepancies or misconfigurations in the Pager that could be contributing to the error.

- **Check Pager Service Logs**

    - Navigate to the Operations App, and switch to its Core Kernel Tab, within the Pods section you will find the Pager API Service pod. By clicking on it you check out the Pod Details, Pod YAML, Pod Logs, and Pod Usage.

    <div style="text-align: center;">

      <figcaption><i>Pager Service pod logs</i></figcaption>
    </div>

    - Analyze the logs for any error messages or exceptions that might provide insights into the cause of the issue.
