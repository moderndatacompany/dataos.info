# Inspecting the Spark UI


Spark provides an elaborate web UI that allows us to inspect various components of our Flare Jobs. It offers details on memory usage, jobs, stages, and tasks, as well as event timelines, logs, and various metrics and statistics that can give you insight into what transpires in your Flare Jobs, both at the Spark driver level and in individual executors.

## Launching the Spark UI

Spark UI can be accessed by using the following command on the terminal

```bash
dataos-ctl develop port-forward -n <name-of-the-pod> -p <port-mapping-of-the-pod> #by default port mapping of the pod is 3000:3000
```

**Example**

```bash
dataos-ctl develop port-forward -n ingest-fibo-raw-data-lqiw-1031175555-driver  -p 4000:4040
```

## Conclusion

The Spark UI provides a wealth of information that you can use for debugging and troubleshooting issues with your Spark applications. Additionally, it also provides access to both driver and executor stdout/stderr logs, where you might have logged debugging information. To know more about debugging visit the debugging page Link
