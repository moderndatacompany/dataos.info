# Bucketing


Bucketing is an optimization technique that helps to prevent the shuffling and sorting of data during compute-heavy operations such as joins. Based on the bucketing columns we specify, data is collected in a number of bins.

## Bucketing vs Partitioning

Bucketing is similar to partitioning, but in the case of partitioning, we create directories for each partition. In bucketing, we create equal-sized buckets, and data is distributed across these buckets by a hash on the value of the bucket.

## When to use bucketing?

Bucketing is helpful in the following scenarios:

- When joins are performed between dimension tables that contain primary keys for joining.
- When join operations are being performed between small and large tables.
- Where the data is heavily skewed, or for executing faster joins on a cluster we can also use the bucketing technique to improve performance.

## Configurations

```yaml
partitionSpec:
	- type: bucket # select type bucket
		column: week_year_column # bucketing column
		numBuckets: 2 # number of buckets
```

**Toolbox Workflow**

This additional workflow is only required if your current icebase depot is based on Hadoop catalogue and Hive metastore. However, in the case where the catalog is based on Hadoop and REST Metastore, the additional metadata setting operation is not required.

```yaml
version: v1
name: datatool-wf-sample
type: workflow
workflow:
  dag:
  - name: dataos-tool-simple-bucket
    spec:
      stack: toolbox
      compute: runnable-default
      stackSpec:
        dataset: dataos://icebase:sample/unpivot_data_02
        action:
          name: set_version
          value: latest
```

If one attempts to  set metadata on the icebase depot based on REST metastore the following error will encounter:

```bash
âžœ  ~ dataos-ctl dataset set-metadata -a dataos://icebase:retail/city -v latest

ERRO[0001] ðŸ“‚ set metadata...error                       
ERRO[0001] set metadata operation is restricted to Hadoop Catalog and HIVE Metastore based depot, for given depot: icebase, icebergCatalogType: HADOOP and metastoreType: REST
