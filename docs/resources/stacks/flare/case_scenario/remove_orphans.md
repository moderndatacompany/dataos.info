# Remove Orphans


The `remove_orphans` [action](/resources/stacks/flare/configurations/#remove-orphans) cleans up orphans files older than a specified time period. This action may take a long time to finish if you have lots of files in data and metadata directories. It is recommended to execute this periodically, but you may not need to execute this often. 

<aside>

üó£Ô∏è **Note:** It is dangerous to remove orphan files with a retention interval shorter than the time expected for any write to complete because it might corrupt the table if in-progress files are considered orphaned and are deleted. The default interval is 3 days.
