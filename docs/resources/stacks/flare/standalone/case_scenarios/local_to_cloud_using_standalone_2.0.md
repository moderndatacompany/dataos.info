# Local to Cloud using Standalone 2.0

Let‚Äôs take a case scenario, where we read data from the Local system and write it to the environment Pulsar.

To know more about the details of other supported input and output data sources navigate to the following [link](/resources/stacks/flare/standalone/standalone_yaml_configurations/)

But before diving right into the programming stuff, let‚Äôs make sure that we have the required prerequisites.

## Pre-Requisites

### **Install/Update DataOS CLI with the latest version**

DataOS CLI should be installed on your system with the latest version. To get the details of the CLI version run the command, after logging into DataOS

```bash
dataos-ctl version
```

> **Note:** Make sure you are logged into DataOS before executing the above command. In case you haven‚Äôt logged in, execute `dataos-ctl login` in the terminal
> 

If CLI is not updated to the latest version, navigate to the below page

[CLI](/interfaces/cli)

### **Get the Pulsar-admin tag**

Since we would be dealing with Pulsar format, you will need the `pulsar-admin` tag to write the data to the environment pulsar. To check the available tags that you have, execute the command:

```bash
dataos-ctl user get
# Output
			NAME     |     ID      |  TYPE  |        EMAIL         |              TAGS               
---------------|-------------|--------|----------------------|---------------------------------
	  IamGroot   |   iamgroot  | person |  iamgroot@tmdc.io    | roles:direct:collated,                                          
               |             |        |                      | roles:id:data-dev,              
               |             |        |                      | roles:id:depot-manager,         
               |             |        |                      | roles:id:depot-reader,          
               |             |        |                      | **roles:id:pulsar-admin**,    # this is the required Pulsar-admin tag     
               |             |        |                      | roles:id:system-dev,            
               |             |        |                      | roles:id:user,                  
               |             |        |                      | users:id:iamgroot

```

<aside class="callout">
üó£Ô∏è In the case where you don‚Äôt have the `pulsar-admin` tag contact the system administrator.

### **Operationalize Docker, if you wanna Read/Write IO Locally**

Docker should be installed and running on the system. If Docker is installed on your system, move to the next step in case it's not installed, visit the official Docker installation page for the same by clicking the [link](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

### **Basics of Scala Programming**

Flare Standalone uses Scala Programming Language. In case you don‚Äôt have any idea about Scala, no worries we have got you covered with some basic commands that will help you make the most of Standalone.

## Getting started

### **Download and Unzip Sample Data**

1. Download the `flare-standalone-2.zip` folder provided below

[flare-standalone-2.zip](/resources/stacks/flare/standalone/case_scenarios/local_to_cloud_using_standalone_2.0/flare_standalone_2.zip/)

1. Extract the downloaded `flare-standalone-2.zip` file. It contains only one folder by the name `standalone`. Open the code editor inside the `flare-standalone-2` folder.
2. Now the scenario looks like the image below, where you have opened the code-editor inside the `flare-standalone-2` folder which contains the `standalone` folder which further contains one folder by the name `default` directory having the `transactions` data and another file by the name `pulsar-write.yaml`

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="/resources/stacks/flare/standalone/case_scenarios/local_to_local_using_standalone_2.0/untitled.png" alt="Untitled" style="border:1px solid black; width: 80%; height: auto;">
</div>


### **Adding details to the Flare Standalone Workflow YAML**

1. Open `pulsar-write.yaml` file using the code editor. The YAML looks like the one given below

```yaml
version: v1
name: standalone-write-pulsar
type: workflow
tags:
  - standalone
  - writeJob
  - pulsar
title: Write to pulsar in standalone mode
description: |
  The purpose of this workflow is to verify if we are able to read different
  file formats & write by exploring standalone mode. 

workflow:
  dag:
    - name: standalone-pulsar-write
      title: Write to pulsar using standalone mode
      description: |
        The purpose of this job is to verify if we are able to read different
        file formats & write by exploring standalone mode.
      spec:
        tags:
          - standalone
          - writeJob
          - pulsar
        envs:
          PULSAR_SSL: true
          ENABLE_PULSAR_AUTH: true
          DATAOS_RUN_AS_APIKEY: <dataos-api-key>
        stack: flare:3.0
        compute: runnable-default
        flare:
          job:
            explain: true
            logLevel: INFO
            inputs:
              - name: oms_transactions_data
                inputType: file
                file:
                  path: /data/examples/default/transactions/
                  format: json
            outputs:
              - name: finalDf
                outputType: pulsar
                pulsar:
                  serviceUrl: pulsar+ssl://<protocol>.<dataos-context>:<port>
                  adminUrl: https://tcp.<dataos-context>:<port>
                  topic: transactions12
            steps:
              - sequence:
                  - name: finalDf
                    sql: SELECT * FROM oms_transactions_data LIMIT 10
```

1. Naming convention for local read/write IO
The paths given in the sample `pulsar-write.yaml` for local read/write are the docker container paths where the data will be mounted.
If your data is located at the path let‚Äôs say `standalone/default/transactions/`, your data is present inside the `transactions` and you have opened the terminal inside the `standalone` folder the input file path in YAML will be `/data/examples/data/transactions/` But if you have opened the terminal outside the `standalone` folder, `the` path will be `/data/examples/standalone/data/transactions/` 
You can store the data directory and the `pulsar-write.yaml` anywhere you want you just have to configure the paths accordingly.
2. You also require the DataOS `prime apikey` which you can get by executing the below command

```bash
dataos-ctl user apikey get
```

If you don‚Äôt have it you can also create a new one

3. Now the last and final aspect that‚Äôs missing is the `serviceUrl` and the `adminUrl`, for which you require two things 
    1. `<dataos-context>` - This is provided by the system administrator in your organization
    2. `<port>` - The serviceUrl and AdminUrl ports are available in the Operations App. To know more, navigate to the below page
    
    [Getting the Port of Service and AdminUrl](/resources/stacks/flare/standalone/case_scenarios/local_to_cloud_using_standalone_2.0/getting_the_port_of_serviceurl_and_adminurl/)
    

### **Running the Flare Workflow YAML**

1. Use the below command to run the `pulsar-write.yaml`.

```bash
dataos-ctl develop start -s <flare-version> -i <custom-image> -f <path-of-config.yaml> -d <path-of-data-directory> -P <port-number>
```

Example

```bash
dataos-ctl develop start -s flare:3.0 -i rubiklabs/flare3:6.0.93 -f standalone/pulsar/pulsar-write.yaml -d standalone -P 14044
```

> **Note:** The path of `pulsar-write.yaml` and `standalone` directory could either be absolute or relative path. The port number by default is set at 14040, but if you have a job already running on 14040 you can configure it to a different port e.g. 14044.

<aside class="callout">
üó£Ô∏è <b>Note:</b> In case when you don‚Äôt have the above-mentioned version or image of the flare stack downloaded, it will download it first from the docker registry, and then the execution will start. If you have it installed already, it will jump onto running the job directly. If you have an Apple M1/M2 Chip system, use the `rubiklabs/flare3:6.0.93-xp.01`  docker image.

1. Since we have exposed the Spark Web UI on port 14044, we can type [localhost:14042](http://localhost:14042) in any web browser to check the status of the Job

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="/resources/stacks/flare/standalone/case_scenarios/local_to_cloud_using_standalone_2.0/untitled_1.png" alt="Flare standalone" style="border:1px solid black; width: 80%; height: auto;">
</div>


To know more about the various sections of the Spark UI and what each one of them signifies navigate to the [link](/resources/stacks/flare/optimizations/inspecting_the_spark_ui)

1. On successful execution, the Scala command line shell will open as below:

```bash
2022-12-05 05:28:10,854 INFO  [main] i.d.f.c.ProcessingContext: **run complete.
# When you see this run complete message then only your job has successfully executed**

1. You can check the written topic on the environment Pulsar using the following command

```bash
dataos-ctl fastbase topic -n public/default list
# Expected Output
