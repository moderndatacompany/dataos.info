# Flare Read/Write Config


Flare supports reading and writing data from any source on which a depot can be created; this could be on Object Storage, Relational Databases, NoSQL Databases, Data Warehouses, and Streaming sources like Kafka. At the same time, it can write to DataOS internal Managed Depots like Icebase and Fastbase, etc.

üó£Ô∏è Depots within the DataOS provide access to the data source instead of worrying about the underlying source credentials and storage patterns. Once a depot is connected on top of a source doesn‚Äôt matter if it's a data lake, database, or warehouse, the connection with the source becomes uniform and is represented as a UDL (Universal Data Link) which is of the form `dataos://[depot]:[collection]/[dataset]`.
A Flare Job can only be run on data sources that have established depots on top of them. To learn more about Depots, click [here](../../depot.md)
