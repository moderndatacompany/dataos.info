# Scanner for Pulsar

Pulsar metadata Scanner Workflow can be configured and scheduled through the DataOS CLI. DataOS provides the capability to create a Depot of type 'FASTBASE' for reading topics and messages stored in Apache Pulsar. This Depot allows user to access published topics and process incoming streams of messages effectively. Ensure that all prerequisites are met before initiating the workflow.


## Prerequisites

- Ensure that the depot is created and has `read` access for the Depot using the Metis UI or the CLI:

    ```bash
    dataos-ctl get -t depot -a

    # Expected output

    INFO[0000] üîç get...
    INFO[0000] üîç get...complete

    | NAME             | VERSION | TYPE  | WORKSPACE | STATUS | RUNTIME | OWNER      |
    | ---------------- | ------- | ----- | --------- | ------ | ------- | ---------- |
    | pulsardepot      | v2alpha | depot |           | active |         | usertest   |

    ```

    If the Depot for the Fastbase/Pulsar is not created, create it using the following sample manifest file:

    ```yaml
    name: ${{depot-name}}
    version: v1
    type: depot
    tags: 
      - ${{tag1}}
      - ${{tag2}}
    owner: ${{owner-name}}
    layer: user
    depot: 
      type: PULSAR       
      description: ${{description}}
      external: ${{true}}
      spec:               
        adminUrl: ${{admin-url}}
        serviceUrl: ${{service-url}}
        tenant: ${{system}}
    # Ensure to obtain the correct tenant name and other specifications from your organization.
    ```

- **Access Permissions in DataOS**: To execute a Scanner Workflow in DataOS, verify that at least one of the following role tags is assigned:

    * `roles:id:data-dev`
    * `roles:id:system-dev`
    * `roles:id:user`

    Use the following command to check assigned roles:

    ```bash
    dataos-ctl user get
    ```

    If any required tags are missing, contact a **DataOS Operator** or submit a **Grant Request** for role assignment.

    Alternatively, if access is managed through **use cases**, ensure the following use cases are assigned:

    * **Read Workspace**
    * **Run as Scanner User**
    * **Manage All Depot**
    * **Read All Dataset**
    * **Read All Secrets from Heimdall**

    To validate assigned use cases Contact DataOS Operator, and to know more refer to the [**Bifrost Application Use Cases**](/interfaces/bifrost/ "Bifrost is a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that empowers users to effortlessly create and manage access policies for applications, services, people, and datasets. Bifrost leverages the governance engine of DataOS, Heimdall, to ensure secure and compliant data access through ABAC policies, giving users fine-grained control over the data and resources.") section.
    

## Scanner Workflow for pulsar

Following is the manifest file for scanning metadata from Fastbase/pulsar:

    ```yaml
    version: v1
    name: fastbase-scanner2
    type: workflow
    tags: 
      - fastbase-scanner2.0
    description: The job scans schema tables and register metadata
    workflow: 
      dag: 
        - name: scanner2-fastbase
          description: The job scans schema from fastbase depot tables and register metadata to metis2
          spec: 
            stack: scanner:2.0
            compute: runnable-default
            runAsUser: metis
            stackSpec: 
              depot: pulsardepot
    ```

The above sample manifest file is deployed using the following command:

```bash
dataos-ctl resource apply -f ${{path to the Scanner YAML}}
```

**Updating the Scanner Workflow**:

If the Depot or Scanner configurations are updated, the Scanner must be redeployed after deleting the previous instance. Use the following command to delete the existing Scanner:

```bash 
  dataos-ctl delete -f ${{path-to-Scanner-YAML}}]
```

**OR**

```bash
  dataos-ctl delete -t workflow -n ${{name of Scanner}} -w ${{name of workspace}}
```


!!! info "**Best Practice**"

    As part of best practices, it is recommended to regularly delete Resources that are no longer in use. This practice offers several benefits, including saving time and reducing costs.
