# Core Concepts of the Scanner Stack

The Scanner facilitates metadata extraction by utilizing [Depots](/resources/depot/) to connect to the metadata source.  The core concepts include:

* **Metadata Extraction**: Collects metadata from source systems, DataOS services, and components.

* **Scanner Job**: A fundamental unit of work within a **Workflow** that performs metadata extraction.

* **Source**: The metadata source from which the Scanner Stack extracts metadata.

* **Metadata Store**: Extracted metadata is stored in **MetisDB**, a centralized PostgreSQL database.

* **Scheduled Workflow**: Automates metadata extraction at predefined intervals.

* **Metadata Types**: The Scanner Stack extracts various types of metadata, including:

    * General dataset/table information (e.g., names, owners, tags)

    * Detailed metadata (e.g., table schemas, column names, descriptions)

    * Data quality and profiling information

    * User and owner details

    * Data product metadata (e.g., inputs, outputs, SLOs, policies, lineage)

## How the Scanner Stack Works

In DataOS, metadata extraction is orchestrated using two different types of DataOS resources: **Workflow** and **Worker**. The choice of orchestrator depends on the specific use case:

* **Workflow Resource**: Used for batch workloads that perform metadata extraction at scheduled intervals.

* **Worker Resource**: Used for long-running, continuous workloads that push metadata to **MetisDB** in real-time.

### **Metadata Extraction Process**

The Scanner Stack follows an **ETL-like process** (Extract, Transform, Load):

1. **Extract**

    * The **source system** is defined in the **Depot**, which establishes the connection to the metadata source.

    * The Scanner Stack extracts metadata from the connected source.

2. **Transform**

    * Metadata is standardized into a common format for consistency across DataOS.

3. **Load**

    * Transformed metadata is pushed to the **Metis REST API server**, which stores it in **MetisDB**(PostgreSQL).

    * **Batch-based processing** is handled via **Workflow Resource**, while **continuous ingestion** is performed via **Worker Resource.**

!!! info "**Usage of Extracted Metadata**"

    - Metadata is utilized by various DataOS components for **discoverability, governance, and observability.**
    - External applications running on DataOS can retrieve metadata via **Metis Server APIs.**
    - In DataOS, all metadata entities are **defined and consumed in JSON format.**

In addition to external applications, the Scanner Stack extracts metadata from **DataOS applications and services**. The Scanner job reads relevant metadata and pushes it to **MetisDB** through the **Metis REST API server**, making it accessible via **Metis UI**.‚Å†

### **Scanner Job Integrations with DataOS Components**

**Collation Service**

* Scans and publishes metadata related to DataOS Resources such as Workflows, including execution history, execution states, and job metadata.

* Collects historical metadata for **pods, logs, and processing stacks** like **Flare** and **Benthos**, capturing job information and source-destination relationships.


**Gateway Service**

* Retrieves metadata related to **data profiling** (statistical summaries of datasets) from the Soda.

* Scans **data quality metadata**, capturing checks and their pass/fail status.

* Extracts **query usage insights**, identifying frequently accessed datasets and relationships between datasets.


**Heimdall**

* Scans and retrieves user information within **DataOS**, including user descriptions and profile images, accessible via **Metis UI.** 


**Pulsar Service**

* Listens to messages published by various services and stacks, ensuring real-time metadata updates.
