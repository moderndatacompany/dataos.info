# Scanner for Data Quality Checks

Assertions are business-specific validation rules applied to test and evaluate the quality of specific datasets if they are appropriate for the intended purpose. DataOS allows you to define your own assertions with a combination of tests to check the rules. Flare workflows are run for data quality checks on the entire dataset or sample /filtered data. This analysis is stored in Icebase.

Data quality Scanner workflow reads about these quality checks for your data along with their pass/fail status(metadata extraction related to data quality) and stores it in Metis DB. This data helps you validate the captured data to determine whether the data meets business requirements.

## Metadata on Metis UI

You can view the list of assertions created for the dataset to monitor the data quality and trend charts for each run. The trend charts also show whether the checks are passed or failed.
