# Scanner for Oracle
## Requirements

- Credentials to connect to Oracle database.
- To extract metadata, the MySQL user needs to have access to theÂ `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`.
- Metadata Scan is supported for 12c, 18c, 19c, and 21c versions.
- To ingest metadata from oracle user must haveÂ `CREATE SESSION`Â privilege for the user.

## Depot Scan Workflow

DataOS allows you to connect to a database with JDBC driver to read data from tables using Depot. You can also scan metadata from an Oracle-type depot with Scanner workflows.The Depot enables access to all schemas visible to the specified user in the configured database, Oracle. 

<aside class="callout">
ðŸ—£ Ensure that the depot is created for your Oracle database and you have `Read` access for the depot.

You can apply database, schema, and table filter patterns while scanning metadata.

              databaseFilterPattern:
	              includes:
	                  - database1
	                  - database2
	                excludes:
	                  - database3
	                  - database4
	              schemaFilterPattern:
	                includes:
	                  - schema1
	                  - schema2
	                excludes:
	                  - schema3
	                  - schema4
	              tableFilterPattern:
	                includes:
	                  - table1
	                  - table2
	                excludes:
	                  - table3
	                  - table4
```

After the successful workflow run, you can check the metadata of scanned Tables on Metis UI for all schemas present in the database.

<!-- ## Non-Depot Scan Workflow

You need to provide source connection details and configuration settings, such as metadata type and filter patterns to include/exclude assets for metadata scanning. 

### **Scanner Configuration Properties**

- **Type**: This is source to be scanned; `mysql`
- **Source**: Provide source name where the scanned metadata is saved within Metastore. Under the given source name, you can see the information about all the entities scanned for your data source; `MySQLSource`

### Source **Connection Properties**

- **Username**: Specify the User to connect to Oracle. It should have enough privileges to read all the metadata.
- **Password**: Password to connect to Oracle.
- **Host and Port**: Enter the fully qualified hostname and port number for your Oracle deployment in the Host and Port field.
- **Oracle Connection Type**Â : Select the Oracle Connection Type. The type can either beÂ `Oracle Service Name`Â orÂ `Database Schema`
    - **Oracle Service Name**: The Oracle Service name is the TNS alias that you give when you remotely connect to your database and this Service name is recorded in tnsnames.
    - **Database Schema**: The name of the database schema available in Oracle that you want to connect with.
- **Oracle instant client directory**: The directory pointing to where theÂ `instantclient`Â binaries for Oracle are located. In the ingestion Docker image weÂ provide them by default atÂ `/instantclient`. If this parameter is informed (it is by default), we will run theÂ **[thick oracle client](https://python-oracledb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/initialization.html#initializing-python-oracledb)**.Â We are shipping the binaries for ARM and AMD architectures fromÂ **[here](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/instant-client/linux-x86-64-downloads.html)**Â andÂ **[here](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/instant-client/linux-arm-aarch64-downloads.html)**Â for the instant client version 19.
- **Connection Options (Optional)**: Enter the details for any additional connection options that can be sent to Oracle during the connection. These details must be added as Key-Value pairs.
- **Connection Arguments (Optional)**: Enter the details for any additional connection arguments such as security or protocol configs that can be sent to Oracle during the connection. These details must be added as Key-Value pairs.
    - In case you are using Single-Sign-On (SSO) for authentication, add theÂ `authenticator`Â details in the Connection Arguments as a Key-Value pair as follows:Â `"authenticator" : "sso_login_url"`
    - In case you authenticate with SSO using an external browser popup, then add theÂ `authenticator`Â details in the Connection Arguments as a Key-Value pair as follows:Â `"authenticator" : "externalbrowser"`

### **Non-Depot Scan Workflow YAML**

In this example, sample source connection and configuration settings are provided.
