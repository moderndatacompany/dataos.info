## Examples[](https://www.benthos.dev/docs/components/inputs/cassandra/#examples)

### Minimal Select (Cassandra/Scylla)

Let's presume that we have 3 Cassandra nodes, like in this tutorial by Sebastian Sigl from [freeCodeCamp.](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-apache-cassandra-beginner-tutorial/)


Then if we want to select everything from the table users_by_country, we should use the configuration below. If we specify the stdin output, the result will look like:

```json
{"age":23,"country":"UK","first_name":"Bob","last_name":"Sandler","user_email":"[bob@email.com](mailto:bob@email.com)"}
```

This configuration also works for Scylla.

```yaml
input:
  cassandra:
    addresses:
      - 172.17.0.2
    query:
      'SELECT * FROM learn_cassandra.users_by_country'
```
