# kafka_franz

> ðŸ—£ BETA
This component is mostly stable, but breaking changes could still be made outside of major version releases if a fundamental problem with the component is found.

An alternative Kafka input using theÂ [Franz Kafka client library](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go).

## YAML Configurations

### Common Config

```yaml
# Common config fields, showing default values
input:
  label: ""
  kafka_franz:
    seed_brokers: []
    topics: []
    regexp_topics: false
    consumer_group: ""
```

### Advanced Config

```yaml
# All config fields, showing default values
input:
  label: ""
  kafka_franz:
    seed_brokers: []
    topics: []
    regexp_topics: false
    consumer_group: ""
    checkpoint_limit: 1024
    commit_period: 5s
    start_from_oldest: true
    tls:
      enabled: false
      skip_cert_verify: false
      enable_renegotiation: false
      root_cas: ""
      root_cas_file: ""
      client_certs: []
    sasl: []
    multi_header: false
```

Consumes one or more topics by balancing the partitions across any other connected clients with the same consumer group.

### Metadata

This input adds the following metadata fields to each message:

```
- kafka_key
- kafka_topic
- kafka_partition
- kafka_offset
- kafka_timestamp_unix
- All record headers
```

## Fields

### `seed_brokers`

A list of broker addresses to connect to in order to establish connections. If an item of the list contains commas, it will be expanded into multiple addresses.

Type:Â `array`

```yaml
# Examples

seed_brokers:
  - localhost:9092

seed_brokers:
  - foo:9092
  - bar:9092

seed_brokers:
  - foo:9092,bar:9092
```

---

### `topics`

A list of topics to consume from, partitions are automatically shared across consumers sharing the consumer group.

Type:Â `array`

---

### `regexp_topics`

Whether listed topics should be interpretted as regular expression patterns for matching multiple topics.

Type:Â `bool`

Default:Â `false`

---

### `consumer_group`

A consumer group to consume as. Partitions are automatically distributed across consumers sharing a consumer group, and partition offsets are automatically committed and resumed under this name.

Type:Â `string`

---

### `checkpoint_limit`

Determines how many messages of the same partition can be processed in parallel before applying back pressure. When a message of a given offset is delivered to the output, the offset is only allowed to be committed when all messages of prior offsets have also been delivered, this ensures at-least-once delivery guarantees. However, this mechanism also increases the likelihood of duplicates in the event of crashes or server faults, reducing the checkpoint limit will mitigate this.

Type:Â `int`

Default:Â `1024`

---

### `commit_period`

The period of time between each commit of the current partition offsets. Offsets are always committed during the shutdown.

Type:Â `string`

Default:Â `"5s"`

---

### `start_from_oldest`

If an offset is not found for a topic partition, determines whether to consume from the oldest available offset; otherwise, messages are consumed from the latest offset.

Type:Â `bool`

Default:Â `true`

---

### `tls`

Custom TLS settings can be used to override system defaults.

Type:Â `object`

---

### `tls.enabled`

Whether custom TLS settings are enabled.

Type:Â `bool`

Default:Â `false`

---

### `tls.skip_cert_verify`

Whether to skip server-side certificate verification.

Type:Â `bool`

Default:Â `false`

---

### `tls.enable_renegotiation`

Whether to allow the remote server to repeatedly request renegotiation. Enable this option if you're seeing the error messageÂ `local error: tls: no renegotiation`.

Type:Â `bool`

Default:Â `false`

---

### `tls.root_cas`

An optional root certificate authority to use. This is a string, representing a certificate chain from the parent trusted root certificate, to possible intermediate signing certificates, to the host certificate.

> ðŸ—£ SECRET
This field contains sensitive information that usually shouldn't be added to a config directly, read ourÂ secrets page for more info.


Type:Â `string`

Default:Â `""`

```yaml
# Examples

root_cas: |-
  -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
  ...
  -----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

### `tls.root_cas_file`

An optional path of a root certificate authority file to use. This is a file, often with a .pem extension, containing a certificate chain from the parent trusted root certificate, to possible intermediate signing certificates, to the host certificate.

Type:Â `string`

Default:Â `""`

```yaml
# Examples

root_cas_file: ./root_cas.pem
```

### `tls.client_certs`

A list of client certificates to use. For each certificate, either the fieldsÂ `cert`Â andÂ `key`, orÂ `cert_file`Â andÂ `key_file`Â should be specified, but not both.

Type:Â `array`

```yaml
# Examples

client_certs:
  - cert: foo
    key: bar

client_certs:
  - cert_file: ./example.pem
    key_file: ./example.key
```

---

### `tls.client_certs[].cert`

A plain text certificate to use.

Type:Â `string`

Default:Â `""`

---

### `tls.client_certs[].key`

A plain text certificate key to use.

> ðŸ—£ SECRET
This field contains sensitive information that usually shouldn't be added to a config directly, read ourÂ secrets page for more info.

Type:Â `string`

Default:Â `""`

---

### `tls.client_certs[].cert_file`

The path of a certificate to use.

Type:Â `string`

Default:Â `""`

---

### `tls.client_certs[].key_file`

The path of a certificate key to use.

Type:Â `string`

Default:Â `""`

---

### `tls.client_certs[].password`

A plain text password for when the private key is password encrypted in PKCS#1 or PKCS#8 format. The obsoleteÂ `pbeWithMD5AndDES-CBC`Â algorithm is not supported for the PKCS#8 format. Warning: Since it does not authenticate the ciphertext, it is vulnerable to padding oracle attacks that can let an attacker recover the plaintext.

> ðŸ—£ SECRET

Type:Â `string`

Default:Â `""`

```yaml

```

---

### `sasl`

Type:Â `array`

```yaml
# Examples

sasl:
  - mechanism: SCRAM-SHA-512
    password: bar
    username: foo
