# Serverless

Currently the only supported serverless deployment of Benthos is for AWS Lambda.

## Lambda

The `benthos-lambda` distribution is a version of Benthos specifically tailored for deployment as an AWS Lambda function on the `go1.x` runtime, which runs Amazon Linux on the `x86_64` architecture. The `benthos-lambda-al2` distribution supports the `provided.al2` runtime, which runs Amazon Linux 2 on either the `x86_64` or `arm64` architecture.

It uses the same configuration format as a regular Benthos instance, which can be provided in 1 of 2 ways:

- Inline via the `BENTHOS_CONFIG` environment variable (YAML format).
- Via the filesystem using a layer, extension, or container image. By default, the `benthos-lambda` distribution will look for a valid configuration file in the locations listed below. Alternatively, the configuration file path can be set explicity by passing a `BENTHOS_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable.
    - ./benthos.yaml
    - ./config.yaml
    - /benthos.yaml
    - /etc/benthos/config.yaml
    - /etc/benthos.yaml

Also, the `http`, `input` and `buffer` sections are ignored as the service wide HTTP server is not used, and messages are inserted via function invocations.

If the `output` section is omitted in your config then the result of the processing pipeline is returned back to the caller, otherwise the resulting data is sent to the output destination.

## Running with an output

The flow of a Benthos lambda function with an output configured looks like this:

```
                    benthos-lambda
           +------------------------------+
           |                              |
       -------> Processors ----> Output -----> Somewhere
invoke     |                              |        |
       <-------------------------------------------/
           |         <Ack/Noack>          |
           |                              |
           +------------------------------+
```

Where the call will block until the output target has confirmed receipt of the resulting payload. When the message is successfully propagated a JSON payload is returned of the form {"message":"request successful"}, otherwise an error is returned containing the reason for the failure.

## Running without an output

The flow when an output is not configured looks like this:

```
               benthos-lambda
           +--------------------+
           |                    |
       -------> Processors --\  |
invoke     |                 |  |
       <---------------------/  |
           |     <Result>       |
           |                    |
           +--------------------+
```

Where the function returns the result of processing directly back to the caller. The format of the result differs depending on the number of batches and messages of a batch that resulted from the invocation:

Single message of a single batch: {} (JSON object)
Multiple messages of a single batch: [{},{}] (Array of JSON objects)
Multiple batches: [[{},{}],[{}]] (Array of arrays of JSON objects, batches of size one are a single object array in this case)
Processing Errors
The default behaviour of a Benthos lambda is that the handler will not return an error unless the output fails. This means that errors that occur within your processors will not result in the handler failing, which will instead return the final state of the message.

In the next major version release (V4) this will change and the handler will fail if messages have encountered an uncaught error during execution. However, in the meantime it is possible to configure your output to use the new reject output in order to trigger a handler error on processor errors:

```yaml
output:
  switch:
    retry_until_success: false
    cases:
      - check: '!errored()'
        output:
          sync_response: {}
      - output:
          reject: "processing failed due to: ${! error() }"
```

## Running a combination

It's possible to configure pipelines that send messages to third party destinations and also return a result back to the caller. This is done by configuring an output block and including an output of the type sync_response.

For example, if we wished for our lambda function to send a payload to Kafka and also return the same payload back to the caller we could use a broker:

```yaml
output:
  broker:
    pattern: fan_out
    outputs:
    - kafka:
        addresses:
        - todo:9092
        client_id: benthos_serverless
        topic: example_topic
    - sync_response: {}
```

## Upload to AWS

### **go1.x on x86_64**

Grab an archive labelled benthos-lambda from the releases page page and then create your function:

```shell
LAMBDA_ENV=`cat yourconfig.yaml | jq -csR {Variables:{BENTHOS_CONFIG:.}}`
aws lambda create-function \
  --runtime go1.x \
  --handler benthos-lambda \
  --role benthos-example-role \
  --zip-file fileb://benthos-lambda.zip \
  --environment "$LAMBDA_ENV" \
  --function-name benthos-example
```

There is also an example SAM template and Terraform resource in the repo to copy from.

### **provided.al2 on amd64**

Grab an archive labelled benthos-lambda-al2 for arm64 from the releases page page and then create your function (AWS CLI v2 only):

```shell
LAMBDA_ENV=`cat yourconfig.yaml | jq -csR {Variables:{BENTHOS_CONFIG:.}}`
aws lambda create-function \
  --runtime provided.al2 \
  --architectures arm64 \
  --handler not.used.for.provided.al2.runtime \
  --role benthos-example-role \
  --zip-file fileb://benthos-lambda.zip \
  --environment "$LAMBDA_ENV" \
  --function-name benthos-example
```

There is also an example SAM template and Terraform resource in the repo to copy from.

Note that you can also run `benthos-lambda-al2` on x86_64, just use the `amd64` zip instead.

## Invoke

```shell
aws lambda invoke \
  --function-name benthos-example \
  --payload '{"your":"document"}' \
  out.txt && cat out.txt && rm out.txt
```

## Build
You can build and archive the function yourself with:

```shell
go build github.com/benthosdev/benthos/v4/cmd/serverless/benthos-lambda
zip benthos-lambda.zip benthos-lambda
```
