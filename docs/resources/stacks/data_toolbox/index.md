# Toolbox Stack

Data Toolbox Stack or simply Toolbox Stack provides vital functionality in case of metadata updation in [Icebase](/resources/depot#icebase) depots. When data is ingested into Icebase using [Flare](/resources/stacks/flare/) Stack, the metadata of ingested datasets needs to be registered with [Metis](/interfaces/metis/) before it can be queried using [Workbench](/interfaces/workbench/). The Data Toolbox allows `set_version` action on the data stored in the DataOS internal storage Icebase, which uses the Iceberg format. The [Metis](/interfaces/metis/) keeps track of the Iceberg table by storing a reference to the latest metadata file. Using the Data Toolbox `set_version` action, you can update the metadata version to the latest or any specific version.

## Syntax of Data Toolbox YAML Configuration

![Data Toolbox YAML Configuration Syntax](/resources/stacks/data_toolbox/data_toolbox_syntax.png)

## Performing Data Toolbox Actions

You can write Data Toolbox action as a separate workflow or part of a dag in a workflow. 

<aside class="callout">
üó£Ô∏è For batch workloads, you can use both ways of performing the Toolbox action but for streaming workloads, you need to create separate workflows for Flare and Toolbox.

</aside>

## Toolbox Action as a separate Workflow

To perform a data toolbox action, follow the below steps:

### **Create a YAML file for Workflow**

If you have already ingested data, you can create a separate workflow for toolbox action, as shown in the following YAML. To know more about workflows, click [here](/resources/workflow/). 

### **Define a Job that executes upon Toolbox Stack**

Within the DAG, define a job that executes upon the Toolbox Stack. To know more about the various properties for a job executed upon toolbox stack, click [here](/resources/workflow/configurations/). 

**Sample Toolbox Workflow**

```yaml
version: v1 
name: dataos-toolbox-workflow 
type: workflow 
workflow: 
  dag: 
    - name: dataos-toolbox-city-01 
      spec: 
      stack: toolbox 
      compute: runnable-default 
      stackSpec: 
        dataset: dataos://icebase:sample/city?acl=rw 
        action: 
          name: set_version 
          value: latest 
```
The table below elucidates the various attributes within the Toolbox-specific Section.

| Field | Data Type | Default Value | Possible Value | Requirement |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`stackSpec`](/resources/stacks/data_toolbox/data_toolbox_grammar#toolbox) | object | none | none | mandatory |
| [`dataset`](/resources/stacks/data_toolbox/data_toolbox_grammar#dataset) | string | none | any valid iceberg dataset udl address | mandatory |
| [`action`](/resources/stacks/data_toolbox/data_toolbox_grammar#action) | object | none | none | mandatory |
| [`name`](/resources/stacks/data_toolbox/data_toolbox_grammar#name) | string | none | set_version | mandatory |
| [`value`](/resources/stacks/data_toolbox/data_toolbox_grammar#value) | string | none | latest or any other specific metadata version | mandatory |

### **Apply the Workflow using CLI**

Use the apply command to apply the workflow using CLI

```bash
dataos-ctl apply -f <path/file-name> -w <workspace> # By default the workspace is public so you may not include the -w flag
```

## Toolbox Action in a Job within the Flare Workflow

Instead of creating a separate workflow for Toolbox, you can create a single workflow. With a DAG with two jobs, one job runs on Flare Stack while the second one runs on the Toolbox Stack, which depends on the first job for the start of execution.

      compute: runnable-default
      stackSpec:
        dataset: dataos://icebase:retail/city01
        action:
          name: set_version
          value: latest
    dependencies: wf-sample-job-001
```

Once you define the workflow, you can apply it using [CLI](/interfaces/cli/).
