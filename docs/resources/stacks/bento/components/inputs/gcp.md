# gcp_bigquery_select

This component is mostly stable, but breaking changes could still be made outside of major version releases if a fundamental problem with the component is found.

</aside>

Executes aÂ `SELECT`Â query against BigQuery and creates a message for each row received.

```yaml
# Config fields, showing default values
input:
  label: ""
  gcp_bigquery_select:
    project: ""
    table: ""
    columns: []
    where: ""
    job_labels: {}
    priority: ""
    args_mapping: ""
    prefix: ""
    suffix: ""

```

Once the rows from the query are exhausted, this input shuts down, allowing the pipeline to gracefully terminate (or the next input in aÂ sequenceÂ to execute).

## Examples

### Word counts

Here we query the public corpus of Shakespeare's works to generate a stream of the top 10 words that are 3 or more characters long:

```yaml
input:
  gcp_bigquery_select:
    project: sample-project
    table: bigquery-public-data.samples.shakespeare
    columns:
      - word
      - sum(word_count) as total_count
    where: length(word) >= ?
    suffix: |
      GROUP BY word
      ORDER BY total_count DESC
      LIMIT 10
    args_mapping: |
      root = [ 3 ]

```
