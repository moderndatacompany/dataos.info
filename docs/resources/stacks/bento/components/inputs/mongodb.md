# mongodb

> ðŸ—£ EXPERIMENTAL
This component is experimental and, therefore, subject to change or removal outside of major version releases.

Executes a find query and creates a message for each row received.

## YAML Configurations

### Common Config

```yaml
# Common config fields, showing default values
input:
  label: ""
  mongodb:
    url: ""
    database: ""
    collection: ""
    username: ""
    password: ""
    query: ""
```

### Advanced Config

```yaml
# All config fields, showing default values
input:
  label: ""
  mongodb:
    url: ""
    database: ""
    collection: ""
    username: ""
    password: ""
    operation: find
    json_marshal_mode: canonical
    query: ""
```

Once the rows from the query are exhausted, this input shuts down, allowing the pipeline to gracefully terminate (or the next input in aÂ sequenceÂ to execute).

| Option | Summary |
| --- | --- |
| Canonical | A string format that emphasizes type preservation at the expense of readability and interoperability. That is, conversion from canonical to BSON will generally preserve type information except in certain specific cases. |
| Relaxed | A string format that emphasizes readability and interoperability at the expense of type preservation.That is, conversion from relaxed format to BSON can lose type information. |

### `query`

Bloblang expression describing MongoDB query.
