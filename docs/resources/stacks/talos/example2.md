## Use case

A retail business needs to forecast sales for its various product categories to optimize inventory levels and improve marketing strategies. Traditionally, this involved manual extraction of data from the database, which was time-consuming and prone to errors. By using Talos to create a data API, the business can automate data retrieval, streamline the forecasting process, and provide data scientists with accurate and timely information for better predictive modeling.

## Business Problem

The business faces challenges with:

- **Manual Data Extraction:** Extracting sales data manually is error-prone and inefficient.

- **Data Inconsistency:** Variations in data formats and manual errors lead to inconsistent data.

- **Slow Forecasting:** Time-consuming data retrieval delays forecasting and decision-making.

## Objective

Create a Talos data API to provide up-to-date sales data, including historical sales figures, product categories, and customer demographics. This will allow data scientists to quickly access the data they need for accurate sales forecasting models. 

## Develop the Data Product 

Before moving on to the API creation, we have to make the data, consumption ready by making it reliable, to do so we first have to build the Data Product to streamline the use case. For this usecase we have already developed the Data Product named Sales360 which is now ready to be consumed via API to further streamline the use case.
