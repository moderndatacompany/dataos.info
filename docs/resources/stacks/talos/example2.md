# Usecase

Efficient Customer Insights with Talos.

## Overview

A retail company, "RetailCorp," has an extensive database with multiple tables for customer information, product details, store data, and more. They need to build a robust and scalable API to provide real-time insights into their customer base and product performance. Currently, they face challenges with manual API development, integrating various data sources, and ensuring data security and scalability.

## Current Challenges

- **Manual API Development:** Developing APIs for querying data from various tables requires extensive manual coding and integration efforts. The company’s development team struggles with ensuring reliability and efficiency.

- **Integration Complexity:** The need to combine data from different tables (e.g., /customers, /products, /stores) complicates the process, as each source has different formats and protocols.
- **Security and Compliance:** Ensuring data security and compliance with regulations is challenging, especially when dealing with sensitive customer information.
- **Scalability Issues:** As data grows, the performance of custom APIs can degrade, impacting user experience.
- **Documentation and Usability:** Lack of standardized documentation makes it difficult for developers and AI systems to interact with APIs effectively.

Solution with Talos:

Rapid Development and Integration:

SQL Templates for API Creation: With Talos, RetailCorp can use SQL templates to define API endpoints. For instance, they can create an API endpoint to retrieve customer insights by combining data from /customers, /products, and /stores tables using a single SQL query.
Reduced Coding Effort: Talos abstracts the complexities of direct database interactions, allowing the team to focus on higher-level logic and business rules. This significantly speeds up the development process.
Simplified Data Integration:

Unified API Interface: Talos allows RetailCorp to seamlessly combine data from different sources. For example, a single API endpoint can provide comprehensive customer insights by aggregating data from various tables, making it easier for applications and AI systems to retrieve and analyze relevant information.
Enhanced Security and Compliance:

Data Masking and Validation: Talos ensures data security by masking sensitive information in SQL templates and validating API parameters to prevent malicious requests. This protects customer data and helps RetailCorp comply with regulations like GDPR.
Heimdall Authentication: Secure access to APIs is managed through Heimdall, providing robust authentication and authorization mechanisms to control who can access the data.
Scalability and Performance:

Caching: Talos includes dataset caching to improve API response times and reduce the load on data sources. Cached results ensure faster access to frequently requested data, enhancing the performance of customer insights queries.
Scalable Architecture: Talos’s template-driven approach allows RetailCorp to scale their APIs efficiently. As data volume and user demand increase, Talos handles these changes seamlessly without extensive manual adjustments.
Standardized Documentation and Observability:

Automated Documentation: Talos generates OpenAPI documents automatically, providing clear and standardized documentation for the APIs. This makes it easier for developers and AI systems to understand and interact with the APIs.
Real-time Monitoring: Talos provides real-time metrics and observability through the /metrics endpoint. RetailCorp can monitor API performance and quickly address any issues that arise.
Example API Endpoints with Talos:

Customer Insights: /customer_insights — Aggregates data from /customers, /products, and /stores to provide comprehensive insights about customer behavior and product performance.
Store Performance: /store_performance/:id — Retrieves performance metrics for a specific store, including sales data and customer interactions.
Product Trends: /product_trends — Analyzes product sales trends across different stores and customer segments.
Conclusion: By leveraging Talos, RetailCorp can efficiently build, scale, and manage their data APIs with reduced development effort and improved performance. Talos’s SQL templates simplify data integration, enhance security, and ensure scalable and reliable API services, addressing the company’s key challenges and enabling them to deliver valuable insights to stakeholders more effectively.
