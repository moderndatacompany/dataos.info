# Creating Beacon Service

## Prerequisites

### **Apply the Adequate Access Policy or Assign the Use Case**

Make sure you have an adequate access policy to create a Service. If you donâ€™t have one, refer to the section below:

<aside>
ðŸ—£ To apply the access policy, you will require operator-level access or `roles:id:operator`. Contact the administrator within your organization to get the requisite access.

### **Required Database exists**

Make sure that you have an active Database Primitive/Resource within DataOS, as per the schema you require, in case you donâ€™t have it, navigate to the link below to create one. If you have one, navigate to the next step.

## Letâ€™s Begin!

### **Create a Beacon Service YAML**

To commence the process, we will be creating a Beacon Service YAML that will encompass several essential components. Each of these sections has been elaborated in detail on the various configurations page. The YAML Configuration is provided below:

```yaml
# Resource Section
version: v1 # Manifest Version
name: stores-db # Name of the Resource/Primitive
type: service # Type of Resource (Here its a Service)
tags: # Tags for the Resource
  - syndicate
  - service
service: # Service Section
  replicas: 2 # Replicas
  ingress: # Ingress Section
    enabled: true # Enables Ingress Port
    stripPath: true # Strip Path and then forward the request to the upstream service.
    path: /stores/api/v1 # Path. How your URL is going to appear?
    noAuthentication: true # If true, there is no Authentication
  stack: beacon+rest # Stack (here the flavor is rest)
  envs: # Environment Variable
    PGRST_OPENAPI_SERVER_PROXY_URI: https://<dataos-context>.dataos.app/<database-path> # e.g. https://adapting-spaniel.dataos.app/citybase/api/v1/

# Beacon Stack-specific Section
  beacon: 
    source: # Source Section
      type: database # Source Type
      name: storesdb # Source Name
      workspace: public # Workspace
  topology: # Topology Section
    - name: database # Topology Name
      type: input # Topology Type
      doc: stores database connection # Document of the Topology step
    - name: rest-api # Toplogy Name
      type: output # Topology Type
      doc: serves up the stores database as a RESTful API # Document of the Topology step
      dependencies: # Dependency
      - database # Topology step 2 is dependent on step 1
```

### **Apply the YAML file**

You can apply the YAML file to create a Service resource within the DataOS environment using the command given below:

```bash
dataos-ctl apply -f <path-of-the-config-file> -w <workspace>
```

### **Check Run time**

```bash
dataos-ctl -t service -w <workspace> -n <service-name>  get runtime -r
# Sample
dataos-ctl -t service -w public -n pulsar-random  get runtime -r
```
