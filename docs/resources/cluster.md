# Cluster

A Cluster in DataOS is a [Resource](../resources.md) that encompasses a set of computational resources and configurations necessary for executing data engineering and analytics tasks. It relies on the [Compute](./compute.md) Resource, which provides the required processing power for the workloads executed within the Cluster. 

A Cluster Resource can be provisioned [on-demand](./cluster/on_demand_computing.md), allowing for efficient allocation of resources based on workload-specific requirements. This decoupling of computation and storage, facilitates flexibility, cost-efficiency and scalability.

üó£Ô∏è To establish a Cluster, it is mandatory to possess the <code>roles:id:operator</code> tag. If this tag is not present, contact the DataOS Operator within your organization to assign you the specific use-case or the requisite tag to obtain the required access.

## Query Engines on Clusters

Within a Cluster, the provisioned group of machines work together to process queries submitted to a query engine. DataOS supports a single type of query engine known as *Minerva*. Minerva Clusters are specifically designed to cater to exploratory, querying, and ad-hoc analytics workloads. These Clusters can be created and connected to the desired Compute Resource. In cases where a single Minerva Cluster proves insufficient, multiple Clusters can be effortlessly created to cater to the distinct demands of different workloads. This workload distribution across clusters guarantees optimal performance and resource utilization.

### **Minerva**

Minerva is an interactive query engine, based on Trino, meticulously crafted to efficiently execute analytical and exploratory workloads. It empowers data developers to effortlessly query diverse data sources using a unified, high-performance SQL interface. With Minerva, data analysis of substantial data volumes becomes simpler, eliminating the need to handle intricate underlying configurations and data formats. 

To maximize performance, organizations can establish Minerva query engine clusters capable of effortlessly handling heavy workloads. These clusters enable the concurrent execution of memory-intensive, I/O-intensive, long-running, and CPU-intensive queries, ensuring efficient processing of diverse data scenarios. 

#### **Querying Diverse Data Sources**

Minerva supports an extensive range of data sources, encompassing both traditional relational databases such as Oracle, PostgreSQL, MySQL, and Redshift, non-relational sources like Kafka and Cassandra, as well as object storages like Amazon S3, and Google Cloud Storage. This broad compatibility ensures seamless access to various data sources, enabling comprehensive and integrated analyses. To know more about the various data sources supported by Minerva, click on the following link: [Connectors Configuration.](./cluster/connectors_configuration.md)

#### **Query Execution Process**

When initiating a SQL query from sources such as Workbench, Atlas, Minerva-CLI, JDBC, or Lens App UI, the query is seamlessly directed to the Minerva Gateway Service. The Gateway Service conducts a thorough analysis of the query and the associated tables, forwarding it to the Minerva Clusters for execution. Furthermore, the Gateway Service facilitates data policy decisions, including Masking and Filtering policies. Once the analysis is completed, the query is seamlessly passed on to the Minerva Cluster for execution.

#### **Managing Data Access Policies and Cluster Resources**

Minerva assumes the crucial role of executing access policies based on user tags, proficiently managing Cluster access, and providing users with comprehensive reports in case of query rejections or encountered exceptions during execution. By seamlessly handling these aspects, Minerva offers a robust and reliable environment for executing complex data queries while adhering to data governance and security protocols.

Within DataOS, a Cluster Resource can either be created either by applying the YAML using the DataOS Command Line Interface (CLI), or by using the Operations App's Graphical User Interface (GUI).

## How to create a Cluster Resource?

As Cluster is a Resource-type within DataOS. An instance of the Cluster can be created by configuring the Cluster Resource YAML and applying it via CLI.

## Query Execution Optimization

To achieve enhanced performance and cost efficiency when working with analytical workloads in DataOS, it is crucial to optimize your query execution on Minerva Clusters. The following considerations can assist you in accelerating your queries. For detailed information and guidance, please refer to the provided link: [How to optimize query execution.](./cluster/query_optimization.md)


## Performance Tuning

The Performance Tuning section is dedicated to enhancing the execution efficiency of queries within Minerva Clusters. It provides data developers with the means to attain optimal performance for analytical and exploratory workloads. By employing proven techniques for performance tuning, developers can streamline query execution, minimize resource consumption, and expedite data analysis. For more information, consult our [Performance Tuning](./cluster/performance_tuning.md) page.

The [Recommend Cluster Configuration](./cluster/configuration_recommendations.md) contains recommendations specifically curated to maximize the efficiency and effectiveness of Minerva Cluster for specific scenarios.


## Connectors Configuration

The Minerva query engine supports a wide range of connectors, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and Redshift. These connectors are configured in a YAML file, where they are mounted as catalogs. The catalogs store schemas and enable referencing of data sources through the respective connectors.

By utilizing these connectors, you can perform data analyses directly on the data sources without the need to transfer the data to DataOS. This approach allows for efficient querying and exploration of data, minimizing data movement. To know more, click on the link: [Connectors Configuration.](./cluster/connectors_configuration.md)


## Case Scenarios

Refer to the Cluster Resource [Case Scenarios](./cluster/case_scenarios.md) documentation for a comprehensive understanding of how Cluster can be utilized. It provides detailed examples and practical implementations to help data developers leverage the Cluster Resource efficiently.
