# Instance Secret

An Instance Secret is a [DataOS resource](../resources.md) designed for securely storing sensitive information at the instance level. This encompasses items like usernames, passwords, certificates, tokens, and keys.

Instance Secret's significance lies in its ability to provide an instance level security for such confidential information, ensuring that it is safeguarded across the entire DataOS Instance. Consolidating sensitive data at this level, offers convenience and efficiency in managing access and permissions, thereby enhancing overall security measures within the platform.

## How to create an Instance Secret?

To create an Instance Secret Resource in DataOS, ensure you have access to the [DataOS Command Line Interface (CLI)](../interfaces/cli.md) and the required permissions. Then, follow the provided steps to complete the creation process efficiently and securely.

### **Structure of Instance Secret YAML file**

The YAML structure for the Instance Secret is outlined as follows:

![Instance Secret YAML Structure](/resources/instance_secret/Slide1.jpg)


### **Create an Instance Secret YAML configuration**

Begin by creating a manifest file that will hold the configuration details for your Instance Secret.
### **Resource meta section**

The Insatnce Secret manifest snippet provided below serves as a reference for the Resource meta section, outlining essential declarations for Instance Secrets. Note that while some attributes are optional, others are mandatory for consistency across all resource types.

```yaml
# Resource meta section
name: {{depotsecret-r}} # Resource name (mandatory)
version: {{v1}} # Manifest version (mandatory)
type: {{resource-type}} # Resource-type (mandatory)
tags: 
  - just for practice # Tags (optional)
description: {{resource description}}
owner: iamgroot
layer: user # Layer (user)
```
For more information about the various attributes in Resource meta section, refer to the Attributes of [Resource meta section](../resources/resource_attributes.md).

### **Instance-Secret specific section**

This section focuses on Instance Secret attributes, outlining essential details such as Instance Secret type, access control list (ACL), and required key-value pairs. Additionally, it allows for the optional inclusion of file paths for manifest files.

```yaml
# Instance-secret specific section
instance-secret:
  type: key-value-properties # Type of Instance-secret (mandatory)
  acl: ${{r|rw}} # Access control list (mandatory)
  data: # Data section mapping (mandatory)
    ${{username: iamgroot}}
    ${{password: abcd1234}}
	files: # Manifest file path (optional)
		${{xyz: /home/instance-secret.yaml}}
```

#### **Instance Secret YAML Configuration Fields**

| Field | Data Type | Default Value | Possible Value | Requirement |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`instance-secret`](./instance_secret/instance_secret_attributes.md#instance-secret) | object | none | none | mandatory |
| [`type`](./instance_secret/instance_secret_attributes.md#instance-secret) | string | none | cloud-kernel, cloud-kernel-image-pull, key-value, key-value-properties, certificates | mandatory |
| [`acl`](./instance_secret/instance_secret_attributes.md#instance-secret) | string | none | r, rw | mandatory |
| [`data`](./instance_secret/instance_secret_attributes.md#instance-secret) | object | none | none | mandatory |
| [`files`](./instance_secret/instance_secret_attributes.md#instance-secret) | string | none | file-path | optional |


For more information about the various attributes in Instance Secret specific section, refer to the Attributes of [Instance Secret specific section](./instance_secret/instance_secret_attributes.md).



### **Apply the Instance Secret YAML**

To implement the Instance Secret YAML, you can utilize the [DataOS Command Line Interface (CLI)](../interfaces/cli.md) by explicitly indicating the path to the YAML file. When applying the YAML file, note that Instance Secrets do not require workspace specification. The apply command is as follows:

=== "Command"
    ```shell
    dataos-ctl apply -f ${path/instance_secret.yaml} -w ${name of the workspace}
    ```
=== "Example Usage"
    ```shell
    dataos-ctl apply -f myinstance_secrets.yaml -w sandbox
    ```

Alternative to the above apply command.

=== "Command"
    ```shell
    dataos-ctl resource apply -f ${path/instance_secret.yaml} -w ${name of the workspace}
    ```
=== "Example Usage"
    ```shell
    dataos-ctl resource apply -f myinstance_secrets.yaml -w sandbox
    ```

## How to manage an Instance-Secret?

### **Validate the Instance Secret**

To validate the proper creation of the Instance Secret Resource within the DataOS environment, employ the `get` command. Execute the following command to ascertain the existence and correctness of the Instance Secret Resource:

=== "Command"

    ```shell
    dataos-ctl get -t instance-secret -w {{workspace}}
    ```

=== "Example Usage"

    ```shell
    dataos-ctl get -t instance-secret -w sandbox
    ```


### **Delete the Instance Secret**

To remove the Instance Secret Resource from the DataOS environment, utilize the `delete` command within the Command Line Interface (CLI). Execute the following command to initiate the deletion process:

**delete command structure for -t (type) and -n (name)**

=== "Command"

    ```shell
    dataos-ctl delete -t {{resource-type}} -n {{resource-name}}
    ```

=== "Example Usage"

    ```shell
    dataos-ctl delete -t instance-secret -n myinstance_secret
    ```


**delete command structure for -i (identifier)**

=== "Command"

    ```shell
    dataos-ctl delete -i {{resource-name:version:resource-type}}
    ```

=== "Example Usage"

    ```shell
    dataos-ctl delete -i myinstance_secret:v1:instance-secret
    ```


Before you can delete an Instance Secret, you need to make sure there are no other resources still utilizing it. For example, if a Depot has a dependency on an Instance Secret, trying to delete that Instance Secret will cause an error. So, you'll need to remove the Depot first, and then you can delete the Instance Secret. This rule applies to both Instance Secrets and Secrets.

An error will be thrown if any resource has a dependency on Instance Secret as shown below.

Example usage:

```shell
dataos-ctl delete -t instance-secret -n sampleinstsecret
INFO[0000] üóë delete...                                  
INFO[0000] üóë deleting sampleinstsecret:v1:instance-secret... 
INFO[0001] üóë deleting sampleinstsecret:v1:instance-secret...error 
WARN[0001] üóë delete...error                             
ERRO[0001] Invalid Parameter - failure deleting instance resource : cannot delete resource, it is a dependency of 'depot:v2alpha:sampleinstdepot'
```

```shell
dataos-ctl delete -t depot -n sampleinstdepot
INFO[0000] üóë delete...                                  
INFO[0000] üóë deleting sampleinstdepot:depot...nothing   
INFO[0000] üóë delete...complete
```

```shell
dataos-ctl delete -t instance-secret -n sampleinstsecret
INFO[0000] üóë delete...                                  
INFO[0000] üóë deleting sampleinstsecret:instance-secret...nothing 
INFO[0000] üóë delete...complete
```

## How to refer Instance Secret into Other Resources

Refering Instance Secrets into various resources involves obtaining dynamically generated credentials and updating configurations for secure access. This process enhances security by mitigating risks associated with static credentials and enables fine-grained control over resource access.

**Syntax**
```yaml


### **Referencing Instance Secrets in a Depot**

Create a YAML file for your Depot. In the application spec of your Depot, ensure to incorporate a reference to the Instance Secret to uphold confidentiality and security measures.

**Instance Secret YAML for Depot**

Example usage:

```yaml
name: depotsecret-r # Resource name (mandatory)
version: v1 # Manifest version (mandatory)
type: instance-secret # Resource-type (mandatory)
tags: # Tags (optional)
  - just for practice
description: instance secret configuration # Description of Resource (optional)
layer: user
instance-secret: # Instance Secret mapping (mandatory)
  type: key-value-properties # Type of Instance-secret (mandatory)
  acl: r # Access control list (mandatory)
  data: # Data section mapping (mandatory)
    username: iamgroot
    password: yourpassword
```
<aside class="callout">

üó£Ô∏è To ensure controlled access for read-write, it is essential to create two Instance Secrets: one with acl:r for read-only access and another with acl:rw for both read and write access and refer to both Instance-Secrets in a Depot. This enables precise management of permissions for different levels of access.

    external: true
    secrets:
      - name: depotsecret-r
         keys:
           - depotsecret-r

    ```

Expected output:

```bash
$ dataos-ctl apply -f /home/shraddhaade/YAMLS/istest.yaml
INFO[0000] üõ† apply...
