# Workflow

The Workflow in DataOS serves as a fundamental [Resource](../resources.md) for orchestrating data processing tasks with dependencies. It enables the creation of complex data workflows by defining a hierarchy based on a dependency mechanism.

## Workflows and Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)

In DataOS, a Workflow represents a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)**, where jobs are represented as nodes, and dependencies between jobs are represented as directed edges. The DAG structure provides a visual representation of the sequence and interdependencies of jobs within a Workflow. This facilitates efficient job execution by enabling parallel and sequential processing based on job dependencies.

Within a Workflow, a **job** encompasses a series of processing tasks, each executed within its dedicated Kubernetes Pod. This architectural design ensures that the computational workload of one job does not hinder the performance of others, effectively avoiding bottlenecks.

Furthermore, every job within a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is associated with a specific [Stack](./stacks.md). A Stack serves as an extension point within a job, offering users the ability to leverage different programming paradigms based on their specific requirements. For instance, if your objective involves data transformation, ingestion, or syndication, utilizing the [Flare](./stacks/flare.md) Stack is recommended. DataOS provides a diverse range of pre-built stacks, including [Flare](./stacks/flare.md), [Scanner](./stacks/scanner.md), [Alpha](./stacks/alpha.md), and more, enabling developers to seamlessly adopt various programming environments to suit their needs.

<center><i>Illustration of Workflow Resource</i></center>

In the depicted example, **Job 1** is the first job to be executed as it has no dependencies. Once **Job 1** completes, both **Job 2** and **Job 3** can run concurrently or parallely. Only after the successful completion of both **Job 2** and **Job 3**, **Job 4** becomes eligible for execution. Finally, **Job 5** can be executed after **Job 4** successfully finishes. This hierarchical structure ensures optimal job execution without creating bottlenecks.

It is important to note that a Directed Acyclic Graph may have multiple root nodes, which means that a Workflow can contain both jobs and other Workflows stored in different locations. This feature allows for the decomposition of complex workflows into manageable components. For more information on this scenario, refer to [Orchestrating Multiple Workflows from a Single Workflow](./workflow/orchestrating_multiple_workflows_from_a_single_workflow.md)


## Types of Workflows

Workflows in DataOS can be categorized as either [single-time run](#single-time-run-workflows) or [scheduled workflows](#scheduled-workflows).

### **Single-time run Workflows**

Single-time run Workflows represent a one-time execution of a sequence of jobs. These workflows do not include scheduling attributes and rely solely on the defined DAG structure and job dependencies.

### **Scheduled Workflows** 
Scheduled Workflows enable the automated and recurring execution of jobs based on specified intervals or predetermined times. To schedule a Workflow, the `schedule` section must be added to the Workflow YAML configuration, allowing the configuration of scheduling attributes. Scheduled Workflows provide a powerful mechanism for automating job execution based on a cron expression. To explore case scenarios for scheduled workflows, refer to the [Scheduled or Cron Workflow](./workflow/scheduled_or_cron_workflow.md)

## Structure of a Workflow YAML

The Workflow Resource is defined using a YAML configuration file. The following example illustrates the structure for defining a single-time run workflow:

![Workflow Resource YAML configuration structure](./workflow/workflow_yaml.png)

<center><i>Workflow Resource YAML configuration structure</i></center>

In the above YAML, each job within the DAG is defined with a unique name, specifications, Stack configuration, Compute settings, and any Stack-specific configurations. Job dependencies are specified to ensure the correct execution order.

For a comprehensive reference of various attributes and their configurations, please consult the [Attributes in Workflow YAML configuration](./workflow/workflow_yaml_attributes_configuration.md)

## How to Create a Workflow?

To create a Workflow Resource, you need to configure the YAML file with the appropriate attributes. The following sections explain the necessary configurations.

### **Workflow YAML Configuration**

#### **Configuring the Resource Section**

A Workflow is a type of Resource in DataOS.The Resource section of the YAML configuration file consists of attributes that are common across all Resource-types. The following YAML snippet demonstrates the key-value properties that need to be declared in this section:

```yaml
name: {{my-workflow}}
version: v1 
type: workflow 
tags: 
  - {{dataos:type:resource}}
  - {{dataos:type:workspace-resource}}
  - {{dataos:resource:workflow}}
description: {{This is a sample workflow YAML configuration}}
owner: {{iamgroot}}
```
<center><i>Resource section configuration</i></center>

For detailed customization options and additional attributes within the Resource section, refer to the [Attributes in Resource YAML configuration](../resources.md#configuration-of-resources).

#### **Configuring the Workflow-specific Section**

The Workflow-specific section contains configurations specific to the Workflow Resource. DataOS supports two types of workflows: scheduled and single-run workflows, each with its own YAML syntax.

**Scheduled Workflow**

A [Scheduled Workflow](#scheduled-workflows) triggers a series of jobs or tasks at particular intervals or predetermined times. To create a scheduled workflow, specify the scheduling [attributes](./workflow/workflow_yaml_attributes_configuration.md#schedule) in the schedule section:
```yaml
workflow:
  schedule:
    cron: {{'/10 * * * *'}}
  dag:
    {{collection-of-jobs}}
```
<center><i>Scheduled Workflow configuration</i></center>

**Single-Run Workflow**

A Single-run Workflow executes only once. A Workflow without a schedule section is considered a single-run workflow. The YAML syntax for a single-run workflow is as follows:
```yaml
workflow:
  dag:
    {{collection-of-jobs}}
```
<center><i>Single-run Workflow configuration</i></center>

Choose the appropriate workflow type based on your requirements. The below table summarizes various attributes within the Workflow-specific section.

<center>

| Attribute | Data Type | Default Value | Possible Value | Requirement |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`workflow`](./workflow/workflow_yaml_attributes_configuration.md#workflow) | object | none | none | mandatory |
| [`schedule`](./workflow/workflow_yaml_attributes_configuration.md#schedule) | object | none | none | optional**  |
| [`cron`](./workflow/workflow_yaml_attributes_configuration.md#cron) | string | none | any valid cron expression. | optional**  |
| [`concurrencyPolicy`](./workflow/workflow_yaml_attributes_configuration.md#concurrencypolicy) | string | Allow | Allow/Forbid/Replace | optional |
| [`startOn`](./workflow/workflow_yaml_attributes_configuration.md#starton) | string | none | any time provided in ISO 8601 format. | optional |
| [`endOn`](./workflow/workflow_yaml_attributes_configuration.md#endon) | string | none | any time provided in ISO 8601 format. | optional |
| [`completeOn`](./workflow/workflow_yaml_attributes_configuration.md#completeon) | string | none | any time provided in ISO 8601 format. | optional |
| [`title`](./workflow/workflow_yaml_attributes_configuration.md#title) | string | none | any valid string | optional |

</center>

<i>optional**:</i> Fields optional for single-run workflows, but mandatory for Scheduled workflows.

For additional details about the attributes within the Workflow-specific section, refer to the link: [Attributes of Workflow-specific section](./workflow/workflow_yaml_attributes_configuration.md#workflow)

#### **Configuring the Job-specific Section**

A Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) represents the sequence and dependencies between various jobs within the Workflow. A DAG must contain at least one job.

**Job**

A Job denotes a single processing task. Multiple jobs within a DAG can be linked sequentially or concurrently to achieve a specific result through `dependencies`. Here is an example YAML syntax for two jobs linked by dependencies:
```yaml
  dag: 
    - name: {{job1-name}}
      spec: 
        stack: {{stack1:version}}
        compute: {{compute-name}}
        stack1: 
          {{stack1-specific-configuration}}
    - name: {{job2-name}}
      spec: 
        stack: {{stack2:version}}
        compute: {{compute-name}}
        stack2: 
          {{stack2-specific-configuration}}
      dependencies: 
       - {{job1-name}}
```
<center><i>Job-specific section YAML Configuration</i></center>

<aside class=callout>

üó£Ô∏è Please be aware that the code block above outlines only the general configuration for a job. The actual attributes and configuration may differ based on the specific <a href="./stacks.md">Stack</a> utilized.

</center>

For additional configuration attributes within the Job-specific section, refer to the [Attributes in Job-specific section YAML configuration.](./workflow/workflow_yaml_attributes_configuration.md#name)

#### **Configuring the Stack-specific Section**

The Stack-specific Section allows you to specify the desired [Stack](./stacks.md) for executing your Workflow. Depending on your requirements, you can choose from the following supported Stacks:

- [Flare Stack](./stacks/flare.md): The Flare stack provides advanced capabilities for data processing and analysis.

- [Alpha Stack](./stacks/alpha.md): The Alpha stack offers a powerful environment for hosting web-application, and custom Docker images atop DataOS.

- [Data Toolbox Stack](./stacks/data_toolbox.md): The Data Toolbox stack provides a comprehensive set of tools and utilities for data manipulation and transformation.

- [Scanner Stack](./stacks/scanner.md): The Scanner Stack provides metadata ingestion capabilities from a source.

To configure the Stack-specific Section, refer to the appropriate Stack documentation for detailed instructions on setting up and customizing the Stack according to your needs. Each Stack has its unique attributes that can enhance the functionality of your Workflow.

```
</details>


### **Applying the Workflow YAML**

Once you have constructed the Workflow YAML file, it's time to apply it and create the Workflow Resource within the DataOS environment. Use the following `apply` command:

```shell
dataos-ctl apply -f {{yaml-file-path}} -w {{workspace}}
```

**Create Your Workspace (Optional)**

This optional step allows you to create a new Workspace for specific workflows. By default, you can always run your workflows in the `public` Workspace. To create a new Workspace, execute the following command:

```shell
dataos-ctl workspace create -n {{name of your workspace}}
```

### **How to Monitor a Workflow?**

#### **Get Status of the Workflow**

To retrieve information about the Workflow, use the `get` command in the CLI. This command lists the workflows created by you. To check this information for all users, add the `-a` flag to the command.

Command:

```shell
dataos-ctl -t workflow -w public get
```

Output:

```shell
INFO[0000] üîç get...
INFO[0001] üîç get...complete

        NAME        | VERSION |   TYPE   | WORKSPACE | STATUS | RUNTIME |   OWNER
--------------------|---------|----------|-----------|--------|---------|-------------
  cnt-product-demo-01 | v1      | workflow | public    | active | running |   tmdc
```

To view workflows created by everyone:

```shell
dataos-ctl -t workflow -w public get -a
```

Output:

```shell
INFO[0000] üîç get...
INFO[0001] üîç get...complete

                 NAME                | VERSION |   TYPE   | WORKSPACE | STATUS |  RUNTIME  |       OWNER
-------------------------------------|---------|----------|-----------|--------|-----------|--------------------
  checks-sports-data                 | v1      | workflow | public    | active | succeeded | user01
  cnt-product-demo-01                  | v1      | workflow | public    | active | running   | tmdc
  cnt-product-demo-01-01               | v1      | workflow | public    | active | succeeded | otheruser
  cnt-city-demo-01001                | v1      | workflow | public    | active | succeeded | user03
```

#### **Get Runtime Information**

To obtain the runtime status of the Workflow, use the following command:

```shell
dataos-ctl get runtime -w {{workspace-name}} -t workflow -n {{name-of-workflow}}
```

Example:

```shell
dataos-ctl get runtime -w public -t workflow -n cnt-product-demo-01
```

Alternatively, you can extract the Workflow information from the output of the `get` command and pass it as a string to the runtime command. Look for the relevant information (highlighted) in the `get` command output:

```shell
dataos-ctl -t workflow -w public get
# the output is shown below
        NAME        | VERSION |   TYPE   | WORKSPACE | STATUS | RUNTIME |   OWNER     
--------------------|---------|----------|-----------|--------|---------|-------------
  <b>cnt-product-demo-01 | v1      | workflow | public</b>    | active | running |   tmdc
```

Select from Name to Workspace, for example `cnt-product-demo-01 | v1 | workflow | public`.

```shell
dataos-ctl -i " cnt-product-demo-01 | v1      | workflow | public" get runtime
```

```
</details>

#### **Get Runtime Refresh**

To see updates on the Workflow progress, execute the following command:

```shell
dataos-ctl -i " cnt-product-demo-01 | v1     | workflow | public" get runtime -r
```

Press `Ctrl + C` to exit.

### **Troubleshooting Workflow Errors**

#### **Check Logs for Errors**

To check the logs for errors, use the following command. Retrieve the node name from the output of the `get runtime` command for the failed node.

Command:

```shell
dataos-ctl -i "{{copy the name-to-workspace in the output table from get command}}" --node {{failed-node-name-from-get-runtime-command}} log
```

Example:

```shell
dataos-ctl -i " cnt-product-demo-01 | v1 | workflow | public" --node city-001-c5dq-0624114155-driver log
```

You will notice an error message: "*There is an existing job with the same workspace. You should use a different job name for your job as you cannot change output datasets for any job.*"

#### **Fix the Errors**

Modify the YAML configuration by changing the name of the Workflow. For example, rename it from `cnt-product-demo-01` to `cnt-city-demo-999`.

#### **Delete the Workflows**

Before re-running the Workflow, delete the previous version from the environment. There are two ways to delete the Workflow as shown below.

**Method 1:** Copy the name-to-workspace from the output table of the `get` command and use it as a string in the delete command.

Command

```shell
dataos-ctl -i "{{name-to-workspace in the output table from get status command}}" delete
```

Example:

```shell
dataos-ctl -i " cnt-product-demo-01 | v1 | workflow | public" delete
```

Output:

```shell
INFO[0000] üóë delete...
INFO[0001] üóë deleting(public) cnt-product-demo-01:v1:workflow...
INFO[0003] üóë deleting(public) cnt-product-demo-01:v1:workflow...deleted
INFO[0003] üóë delete...complete
```

**Method 2:** Specify the path of the YAML file and use the `delete` command.

Command:

```shell
dataos-ctl delete -f {{file-path}}
```

Example:

```shell
dataos-ctl delete -f /home/desktop/flare/connect-city/config_v2beta1.yaml
```

Output:

```shell
INFO[0000] üóë delete...
INFO[0000] üóë deleting(public) cnt-city-demo-010:v1:workflow...
INFO[0001] üóë deleting(public) cnt-city-demo-010:v1:workflow...deleted
INFO[0001] üóë delete...complete
```

**Method 3:** Specify the Workspace, Workflow-type, and Workflow name in the `delete` command.

Command:

```shell
dataos-ctl -w {{workspace}} -t workflow -n {{workflow-name}} delete
```

Example:

```shell
dataos-ctl -w public -t workflow -n cnt-product-demo-01 delete
```

Output:

```shell
INFO[0000] üóë delete...
INFO[0000] üóë deleting(public) cnt-city-demo-010:v1:workflow...
INFO[0001] üóë deleting(public) cnt-city-demo-010:v1:workflow...deleted
INFO[0001] üóë delete...complete
```

#### **Rerun the Workflow**

Run the Workflow again using the `apply` command. Check the runtime for its success. Scroll to the right to see the status, as shown in the previous steps.

Command:

```shell
dataos-ctl -i "{{copy the name-to-workspace in the output table from get status command}}" get runtime -r
```

Example:

```shell
dataos-ctl -i " cnt-city-demo-999 | v1 | workflow | public" get runtime -r
```

Output:

```shell
INFO[0000] üîç workflow...
INFO[0002] üîç workflow...complete

```

Make sure to replace `{{name-to-workspace in the output table from get status command}}` and `{{file-path}}` with the actual values according to your Workflow.
