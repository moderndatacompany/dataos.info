# Workflow

The Workflow in DataOS serves as a [Resource](../resources.md) for orchestrating data processing tasks with dependencies. It enables the creation of complex data workflows by defining a hierarchy based on a dependency mechanism.

## Workflow and Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)

In DataOS, a Workflow represents a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)**, where jobs are represented as nodes, and dependencies between jobs are represented as directed edges. The DAG structure provides a visual representation of the sequence and interdependencies of jobs within a Workflow. This facilitates efficient job execution by enabling parallel and sequential processing based on job dependencies.

Within a Workflow, a **job** encompasses a series of processing tasks, each executed within its dedicated Kubernetes Pod. This architectural design ensures that the computational workload of one job does not hinder the performance of others, effectively avoiding bottlenecks.

Furthermore, every job within a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is associated with a specific [Stack](./stacks.md). A Stack serves as an extension point within a job, offering users the ability to leverage different programming paradigms based on their specific requirements. For instance, if your objective involves data transformation, ingestion, or syndication, utilizing the [Flare](./stacks/flare.md) Stack is recommended. DataOS provides a diverse range of pre-built stacks, including [Flare](./stacks/flare.md), [Scanner](./stacks/scanner.md) and more, enabling developers to seamlessly adopt various programming environments to suit their needs.

In the above illustration, **Job 1** is the first job to be executed as it has no dependencies. Once **Job 1** completes, both **Job 2** and **Job 3** can run concurrently or parallely. Only after the successful completion of both **Job 2** and **Job 3**, **Job 4** becomes eligible for execution. Finally, **Job 5** can be executed sequentially after **Job 4** successfully finishes. This hierarchical structure ensures optimal job execution without creating bottlenecks.

<aside class=callout>

üó£Ô∏è A Directed Acyclic Graph may have multiple root nodes, which means that a Workflow can contain both jobs and other nested Workflows stored in different locations. This feature allows for the decomposition of complex workflows into manageable components. For more information on this scenario, refer to <a href="/resources/workflow/orchestrating_multiple_workflows_from_a_single_workflow/">Orchestrating Multiple Workflows from a Single Workflow.</a>


</aside>


## Types of Workflow

A Workflow in DataOS can be categorized as either [single-run](#single-run-workflow) or [scheduled workflow.](#scheduled-workflow)

### **Single-run Workflow**

Single-run Workflow represent a one-time execution of a sequence of jobs. These workflows do not include scheduling attributes and rely solely on the defined DAG structure and job dependencies. To explore a case scenario for a single-run Workflow, refer to the link: [How to implement Single-run Workflow?](./workflow/single_run_workflow.md)

### **Scheduled Workflow** 

Scheduled Workflow enable the automated and recurring execution of jobs based on specified intervals or predetermined times. To schedule a Workflow, the `schedule` section or mapping along with the scheduling [attributes](./workflow/yaml_configuration_attributes.md#schedule) must be added to the Workflow YAML configuration. Scheduled Workflow provide a powerful mechanism for automating job execution based on a [cron](./workflow/yaml_configuration_attributes.md#cron) expression. To explore a case scenario for a Scheduled Workflow, refer to the link: [How to run a Cron or a Scheduled Workflow?](./workflow/scheduled_or_cron_workflow.md)

## Structure of a Workflow YAML

The Workflow Resource is defined using a YAML configuration file. The following example illustrates the structure for defining a Single-run Workflow:

<center>

![Structure of a Workflow Resource YAML](./workflow/workflow_yaml.png)

</center>

<center><i>Structure of a Workflow Resource YAML</i></center>

The above sample YAML illustrates a [scheduled Workflow](#scheduled-workflow) with a single job. Multiple jobs or nested workflows can be specified within a Workflow DAG and correct execution order is specfied using [dependencies](./workflow/yaml_configuration_attributes.md#dependency). Jobs can also be [retried](./workflow/how_to_retry_jobs.md) by specifying retry strategies. Each job within the DAG is defined with a unique job [name](./workflow/yaml_configuration_attributes.md#name), job [spec](./workflow/yaml_configuration_attributes.md#spec), [Stack](./workflow/yaml_configuration_attributes.md#stack) Resource name and version, [Compute](./workflow/yaml_configuration_attributes.md#compute) Resource name, Stack-specific attributes, and various other optional attributes. 

For a comprehensive reference of various attributes and their configurations, please consult the [Attributes of Workflow YAML.](./workflow/yaml_configuration_attributes.md)

## How to Create a Workflow?

To create a Workflow Resource, you need to configure the attributes of various sections within a Workflow YAML. The sections are provided below:

1. [Resource Section](#configure-the-resource-section)
2. [Workflow-specific Section](#configure-the-workflow-specific-section)
3. [Job-specific Section](#configure-the-job-specific-section)
4. [Stack Specific Section](#configure-the-stack-specific-section)

Each of these sections are mappings and comprise several section-specific attributes. The subsequent parts provide details on the necessary configurations.

### **Workflow YAML Configuration**

#### **Configure the Resource Section**

A Workflow is a [Resource-type](../resources/types_of_dataos_resources.md) in DataOS. The Resource section of the YAML configuration file consists of attributes that are common across all resource-types. The following YAML snippet demonstrates the attributes that need to be declared in this section:

```yaml
name: ${{my-workflow}}
version: v1 
type: workflow 
tags: 
  - ${{dataos:type:resource}}
  - ${{dataos:type:workspace-resource}}
  - ${{dataos:resource:workflow}}
description: ${{This is a sample workflow YAML configuration}}
owner: ${{iamgroot}}
workflow: # Workflow-specific Section
  ${{Attributes of Workflow-specific Section}}
```
<center><i>Resource section configuration</i></center>

For more details regarding the attributes of Resource section, refer to the link: [Attributes of Resource section.](../resources/resource_attributes.md)

#### **Configure the Workflow-specific Section**

The Workflow-specific section contains configurations specific to the Workflow Resource. DataOS supports two types of Workflows: [single-run](#single-run-workflow) and [scheduled](#scheduled-workflow) Workflow, each with its own YAML syntax.

**Single-Run Workflow YAML configuration**

A [Single-run Workflow](#single-run-workflow) executes only once. It does not include a schedule section. The YAML configuration for a single-run Workflow is as follows:

```yaml
workflow:
  dag:
    ${{list-of-jobs}}
```
<center><i>Workflow-specific Section configuration for Single-run Workflow</i></center>

**Scheduled Workflow YAML configuration**

A [Scheduled Workflow](#scheduled-workflow) triggers a series of jobs or tasks at particular intervals or predetermined times. To create a scheduled Workflow, specify the [attributes](./workflow/yaml_configuration_attributes.md#schedule) in the `schedule` section, in the following format:
```yaml
workflow:
  schedule:
    cron: ${{'/10 * * * *'}}
  dag:
    ${{list-of-jobs}}
```
<center><i>Workflow-specific section configuration for Scheduled Workflow</i></center>

Additional, optional attributes of the schedule section are elaborated on the [Attributes of Schedule Section.](./workflow/yaml_configuration_attributes.md#schedule)

The below table summarizes various attributes within the Workflow-specific section.

<center>

| Attribute | Data Type | Default Value | Possible Value | Requirement |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`workflow`](./workflow/yaml_configuration_attributes.md#workflow) | mapping | none | none | mandatory |
| [`schedule`](./workflow/yaml_configuration_attributes.md#schedule) | mapping | none | none | optional**  |
| [`cron`](./workflow/yaml_configuration_attributes.md#cron) | string | none | any valid [cron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) expression. | optional**  |
| [`concurrencyPolicy`](./workflow/yaml_configuration_attributes.md#concurrencypolicy) | string | Allow | Allow/Forbid/Replace | optional |
| [`startOn`](./workflow/yaml_configuration_attributes.md#starton) | string | none | any time provided in [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format. | optional |
| [`endOn`](./workflow/yaml_configuration_attributes.md#endon) | string | none | any time provided in [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format. | optional |
| [`completeOn`](./workflow/yaml_configuration_attributes.md#completeon) | string | none | any time provided in [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format. | optional |
| [`title`](./workflow/yaml_configuration_attributes.md#title) | string | none | any valid string | optional |

</center>

<i>optional**:</i> Attributes optional for a Single-run Workflow, but mandatory for a Scheduled Workflow.

For additional details about the attributes of the Workflow-specific section, refer to the link: [Attributes of Workflow-specific section.](./workflow/yaml_configuration_attributes.md#configuration-attributes)

#### **Configure the Job-specific Section**

A [Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)](#workflow-and-directed-acyclic-graph-dag) represents the sequence and dependencies between various jobs within the Workflow. A DAG must contain at least one job.

**Job**

A Job denotes a single processing task. Multiple jobs within a DAG can be linked sequentially or concurrently to achieve a specific result through [`dependencies`](./workflow/yaml_configuration_attributes.md#dependency). Here is an example YAML syntax for two jobs linked by dependencies:
```yaml
dag: 
  - name: ${{job1 name}}
    spec: 
      stack: ${{stack1:version}}
      compute: ${{compute name}}
      resources:
        requests:
          cpu: ${{requested cpu}}
          memory: ${{requested memory}}
        limits:
          cpu: ${{cpu limits}}
          memory: ${{memory limits}}
      stack1: 
        ${{stack1 specific attributes}}
  - name: ${{job2-name}}
    spec: 
      stack: ${{stack2:version}}
      compute: ${{compute name}}
      stack2: 
        ${{stack2 specific configuration}}
    dependencies: 
      - ${{job1-name}}
```
<center><i>Job-specific section YAML configuration</i></center>

Further, jobs can be retried automatically by pre-defining the retry strategy within the Workflow YAML. This could be helpful in case of job failures or unexpected errors. Learn about job retries by navigating to the following link: [How to retry failed jobs within a Workflow?](./workflow/how_to_retry_jobs.md)

<aside class=callout>

üó£Ô∏è Please be aware that the code block above outlines only the general configuration for a job. The actual attributes may differ based on the specific <a href="./stacks.md">Stack</a> utilized within a job.

</center>

For additional details about attributes of the Job-specific section, refer to the [Attributes of Job-specific section.](./workflow/yaml_configuration_attributes.md#name)

#### **Configure the Stack-specific Section**

The Stack-specific Section allows you to specify the desired [Stack](./stacks.md) for executing your Workflow. Depending on your requirements, you can choose from the following supported Stacks:

- [Flare Stack](./stacks/flare.md): The Flare stack provides advanced capabilities for data processing and analysis.

- [Alpha Stack](./stacks/alpha.md): The Alpha stack offers a powerful environment for hosting web-application, and custom Docker images atop DataOS.

- [Data Toolbox Stack](./stacks/data_toolbox.md): The Data Toolbox stack provides a set of utilities for Depots storing Iceberg datasets, for e.g. Icebase.

- [Scanner Stack](./stacks/scanner.md): The Scanner Stack provides metadata ingestion capabilities from a source.

For more detailed instructions on setting up and customizing the Stack-specific Section attributes according to your needs, refer to the respective documentation of [Flare](./stacks/flare/configurations.md), [Alpha](./stacks/alpha.md#alpha-stack-section), [Data Toolbox](./stacks/data_toolbox/data_toolbox_grammar.md), [Scanner](./stacks/scanner/field_ref.md) Stack. Each Stack has its unique attributes that can enhance the functionality of your job.

                    sql: SELECT * FROM city_connect
```

</details>

### **Apply the Workflow YAML**

Once you have constructed the Workflow YAML file, it's time to [apply](../resources.md#apply) it and create the Workflow [Resource](../resources.md) within the DataOS environment. Use the following [`apply`](../interfaces/cli/command_reference.md#apply) command:

```shell
dataos-ctl apply -f ${{yaml file path}} -w ${{workspace}}
```

Workspace specification is optional. In case its not provided the Workflow runs in the `public` Workspace. To create a new Workspace, execute the [`workspace create`](../interfaces/cli/command_reference.md#workspace) command as shown below and then execute the above command:

```shell
dataos-ctl workspace create -n ${{name of your workspace}}
```

## How to Monitor a Workflow?

### **Get Status of the Workflow**

To retrieve information about the Workflow, use the [`get`](../interfaces/cli/command_reference.md#get) command in the [CLI](../interfaces/cli.md). The command below lists workflows created by the user in a specific Workspace. 

Command:

```shell
dataos-ctl get -t workflow -w public
```

Output:

```shell
INFO[0000] üîç get...
INFO[0001] üîç get...complete

          NAME        | VERSION |   TYPE   | WORKSPACE | STATUS | RUNTIME |   OWNER
----------------------|---------|----------|-----------|--------|---------|-------------
  cnt-product-demo-01 | v1      | workflow | public    | active | running |   tmdc
```

To check this information for all users in a specific Workspace, add the `-a` flag to the command as shown below.

Command:


```shell
dataos-ctl get -t workflow -w public -a
```

Output:

```shell
INFO[0000] üîç get...
INFO[0001] üîç get...complete

          NAME           | VERSION |   TYPE   | WORKSPACE | STATUS |  RUNTIME  |       OWNER
-------------------------|---------|----------|-----------|--------|-----------|--------------------
  checks-sports-data     | v1      | workflow | public    | active | succeeded | user01
  cnt-product-demo-01    | v1      | workflow | public    | active | running   | tmdc
  cnt-product-demo-01-01 | v1      | workflow | public    | active | succeeded | otheruser
  cnt-city-demo-01001    | v1      | workflow | public    | active | succeeded | user03
```

### **Get Runtime Information**

To obtain the runtime status of the Workflow, use the [`get runtime`](../interfaces/cli/command_reference.md#get-runtime) command:

```shell
dataos-ctl get runtime -w ${{workspace-name}} -t workflow -n ${{name of workflow}}
```

Example:

```shell
dataos-ctl get runtime -w public -t workflow -n cnt-product-demo-01
```

Alternatively, you can extract the Workflow information from the output of the [`get`](../interfaces/cli/command_reference.md#get) command and pass it as a string to the [`get runtime`](../interfaces/cli/command_reference.md#get-runtime) command. Look for the relevant information (highlighted) in the [`get`](../interfaces/cli/command_reference.md#get) command output:

```shell
dataos-ctl get -t workflow -w public
# the output is shown below
          NAME        | VERSION |   TYPE   | WORKSPACE | STATUS | RUNTIME |   OWNER     
----------------------|---------|----------|-----------|--------|---------|-------------
  cnt-product-demo-01 | v1      | workflow | public    | active | running |   tmdc
```

Select the workflow details from Name to Workspace tab, for example, `cnt-product-demo-01 | v1 | workflow | public`.

```shell
dataos-ctl get runtime -i "cnt-product-demo-01 | v1      | workflow | public"
```

```
</details>

### **Get Runtime Refresh**

To refresh or see updates on the Workflow progress, add the `-r` flag to the [`get runtime`](../interfaces/cli/command_reference.md#get-runtime) command:

```shell
dataos-ctl -i get runtime " cnt-product-demo-01 | v1     | workflow | public" -r
```

Press `Ctrl + C` to exit.

For any additional flags, use help by appending `-h` with the respective command.

## How to troubleshoot Workflow errors?

### **Check Logs for Errors**

To check the logs for errors, retrieve the node name from the output of the [`get runtime`](../interfaces/cli/command_reference.md#get-runtime) command for the failed node, as shown [here](#get-runtime-information), and execute the command as shown below

Command:

```shell
dataos-ctl -i "${{copy the name to workspace in the output table from get command}}" --node ${{failed node name from get runtime command}} log
```

Example:

```shell
dataos-ctl -i " cnt-product-demo-01 | v1 | workflow | public" --node city-001-c5dq-0624114155-driver log

</details>

You will notice an error message: "*There is an existing job with the same workspace. You should use a different job name for your job as you cannot change output datasets for any job.*"

### **Fix the Errors**

Modify the YAML configuration by changing the name of the Workflow. For example, rename it from `cnt-product-demo-01` to `cnt-city-demo-999`.

### **Delete the Previous Workflow**

Before re-running the Workflow, delete the previous version from the environment. There are three ways to delete the Workflow as shown below.

**Method 1:** Copy the name to Workspace from the output table of the [`get`](../interfaces/cli/command_reference.md#get) command and use it as a string in the delete command.

Command

```shell
dataos-ctl delete -i "${{name to workspace in the output table from get status command}}"
```

Example:

```shell
dataos-ctl delete -i "cnt-product-demo-01 | v1 | workflow | public"
```

Output:

```shell
INFO[0000] üóë delete...
INFO[0001] üóë deleting(public) cnt-product-demo-01:v1:workflow...
INFO[0003] üóë deleting(public) cnt-product-demo-01:v1:workflow...deleted
INFO[0003] üóë delete...complete
```

**Method 2:** Specify the path of the YAML file and use the [`delete`](../interfaces/cli/command_reference.md#delete) command.

Command:

```shell
dataos-ctl delete -f ${{file-path}}
```

Example:

```shell
dataos-ctl delete -f /home/desktop/flare/connect-city/config_v1.yaml
```

Output:

```shell
INFO[0000] üóë delete...
INFO[0000] üóë deleting(public) cnt-city-demo-010:v1:workflow...
INFO[0001] üóë deleting(public) cnt-city-demo-010:v1:workflow...deleted
INFO[0001] üóë delete...complete
```

**Method 3:** Specify the Workspace, Resource-type, and Workflow name in the [`delete`](../interfaces/cli/command_reference.md#delete) command.

Command:

```shell
dataos-ctl delete -w ${{workspace}} -t workflow -n ${{workflow name}}
```

Example:

```shell
dataos-ctl delete -w public -t workflow -n cnt-product-demo-01
```

Output:

```shell
INFO[0000] üóë delete...
INFO[0000] üóë deleting(public) cnt-city-demo-010:v1:workflow...
INFO[0001] üóë deleting(public) cnt-city-demo-010:v1:workflow...deleted
INFO[0001] üóë delete...complete
```

### **Rerun the Workflow**

Run the Workflow again using the [`apply`](../interfaces/cli/command_reference.md#apply) command. 

Command: 

```shell
dataos-ctl apply -f ${{file path}} -w ${{workspace}}
```
Once you have applied the Workflow, check the runtime for its success by using the [`get runtime`](../interfaces/cli/command_reference.md#get-runtime) command

Command:

```shell
dataos-ctl get runtime -i "${{copy the name to workspace in the output table from get status command}}" -r
```

Example:

```shell
dataos-ctl -i "cnt-city-demo-999 | v1 | workflow | public" get runtime -r
```

Output:

```shell
INFO[0000] üîç workflow...
INFO[0002] üîç workflow...complete

```

Make sure to replace `${{name to workspace in the output table from get status command}}` and `${{file path}}` with the actual values according to your Workflow.
