# Instance Secret Attributes
### **Name:**

```yaml
name: {{sampledepot-r|rw}} 
```

Description: A unique identifier for instance secret. The name should follow the [a-z0-9](https://www.notion.so/moderndata/%5B-a-z0-9%5D*%5Ba-z0-9%5D) regex expression. It is important to ensure the Instance Secret's name should reflect the required "-r" or "-rw" extension

Default Value: None

Possible Value: Valid names are allowed to incorporate lowercase letters (a-z), numerical digits (0-9), and hyphens (-). Furthermore, the name is required to commence and conclude with an alphanumeric character, permitting the presence of hyphens within the name, but not consecutively.

Here are some examples of valid names:

- `abc`
- `a1b2c3`
- `name-123`
- `my-name`

Here are some examples of invalid names:

- `123abc` (starts with a number)
- `abc` (starts with a hyphen)
- `name--123` (consecutive hyphens)
- `too-long-name-that-exceeds-48-characters` (exceeds 48 characters)

Example Usage:

```yaml
name: adepot-r
```


>ðŸ—£ When opting for `acl:rw`, it's imperative to establish two Instance Secrets: one configured for `acl:r` and another for `acl:rw`, and refer both Instance Secrets into the Resource YAML.

### **Version:**

```yaml
version: {{v1}} 
```

Description: The version of Instance Secret.

Default Value: V1

Possible Value: Instance Secrets currently have only one version V1, to check out all the versions of different resources use the following CLI command     

```basic
dataos-ctl develop types versions
```


>ðŸ—£ To use the above command you need to have the operator tag.

#### **Types of Instance Secret Resources:**

1. **Key-Value:**
- **Purpose:** The 'key-value' Instance Secret type is a versatile solution for storing key-value pairs of sensitive information. Its simplicity and flexibility make it suitable for many Instance secrets, including usernames, passwords, and API keys.
- **Use Case:** Commonly employed for securely storing sensitive information due to its adaptable and straightforward structure.
2. **Key-value-properties:**
- **Purpose:** The 'key-value-properties' secret type shares similarities with the 'key-value' type but emphasizes properties. It allows for the storage of additional metadata or properties alongside key-value pairs, providing a more structured approach.
- **Use Case:** This type is ideal for scenarios where associating additional metadata or properties with each key-value pair is necessary.
3. **certificates:**
- **Purpose:** The 'certificates' secret type is designed to manage certificates. It facilitates the secure storage of sensitive information about SSL/TLS certificates, ensuring secure communication within a system.
- **Use Case:** Well-suited for securely managing certificates utilized in secure communication protocols.

#### **Instance-secret:acl:**

```yaml
acl: r|rw
```

Description: Access control list, defining the level of permissions for Instance Secret.

Default Value: None

Possible Values: r (Read), rw (Read-Write)

Data Type: String

Requirement: Mandatory

Example Usage:

```yaml
instance-secret: 
type: key-value-properties 
acl: r
```

#### **instance-secret:data:** 

The syntax of data attributes within the instance-secret type can vary depending on its specific type. 

Example usage:

```yaml
data: 
username: iamgroot
password: *******
```

- username:
    Description: The username associated with the secret.
    Data Type: String
    Requirement: Mandatory
- password:
