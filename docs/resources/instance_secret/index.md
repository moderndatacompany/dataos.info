# :resources-instancesecret: Instance Secret

An Instance Secret is a [DataOS Resource](/resources/) designed for securely storing sensitive information at the DataOS instance level. This encompasses sensitive information like usernames, passwords, certificates, tokens, and keys. The primary purpose of Instance Secret is to address the inherent exposure risk associated with directly embedding such confidential data within application code or manifest file (YAML configuration files).

Instance secrets establish a critical segregation between sensitive data and Resource definitions. This division minimizes the chances of inadvertent exposure during various Resource management phases, including creation, viewing, or editing. By leveraging Instance Secrets, data developers ensure the safeguarding of sensitive information, thereby mitigating security vulnerabilities inherent in their data workflows. 

Operators can exercise precise control over who can retrieve credentials from Secrets, if in your organisation any data developer need access to secrets you can assign them a 'read instance secret' use case using [Bifrost](/interfaces/bifrost/).

!!!tip "Instance Secret in the Data Product Lifecycle"

    In the Data Product Lifecycle, Instance Secrets play a crucial role in securely managing credentials and sensitive information. They are particularly useful when your data product requires:

    - **Secure Credential Management**: Storing and managing sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, API keys, or certificates securely within an instance. For example, an instance secret can securely store the credentials needed to connect to a database, ensuring that these credentials are not exposed in the codebase or configuration files.

    - **Access Control**: Ensuring that only authorized components and services within the instance can access the credentials. For instance, an instance secret can be used to provide a web application with the credentials to access a third-party service without exposing those credentials to the broader environment.

    - **Auditing and Compliance**: Maintaining a secure and auditable method of handling sensitive data, complying with security policies and regulatory requirements. Instance secrets ensure that credential usage is logged and can be monitored for compliance purposes.

    By using instance secrets, you can manage sensitive information securely and efficiently, mitigating the risk of exposing credentials while enabling seamless access for your applications and services.

<aside class="callout">

üó£Ô∏è In the DataOS ecosystem, there are two specialized Resources designed to protect sensitive information: Instance Secret and <a href="/resources/secret/">Secret</a>. The Instance Secret offers a wider scope, extending across the entirety of the <a href="/resources/types_of_dataos_resources/#instance-level-resources">DataOS Instance</a>. Resources within any Workspace can utilize Instance Secrets for securely retrieving sensitive data. In contrast, Secrets are limited to the <a href="/resources/types_of_dataos_resources/#workspace-level-resources">Workspace level</a>, accessible exclusively within a specific Workspace and only by Resources associated with that Workspace.

## **Structure of an Instance Secret manifest**

The structure of the Instance Secret manifest file is outlined as follows:

![Instance Secret Manifest Structure](/resources/instance_secret/instance_secret_manifest_structure.jpg)


## Templates

To facilitate the creation of Instance Secret accessing commonly used data sources, we have compiled a collection of pre-defined manifest templates. These templates serve as a starting point.

        To create an instance-secret for securely storing Eventhub credentials, the details required are provided below. Ensure that you replace each placeholder (e.g., `${eventhub-depot-name}`, `${EH_SHARED_ACCESS_KEY_NAME}`) with the actual values pertaining to your Azure Event Hub configuration.

          - `name`: Define the name of your Instance secret `${eventhub-depot-name}-${acl}`. For instance, if your `${eventhub-depot-name}` is alpha and the `acl`(access control list) is `rw`, then the instance secret `name` will be `alpha-rw`.

          - `description`: Provide a brief description of the instance-secret's purpose. This field is optional but recommended for easier management and identification of instance-secrets.

          - `eh_shared_access_key_name`: Your Azure Event Hub shared access key name. This is the identifier for your Event Hub.

          - `eh_shared_access_key`: The shared access key associated with your Azure Event Hub. It is used for authenticating requests to your Event Hub.
