# Azure Blob File System Secure (ABFSS)

An Instance Secret for Azure Blob File System Secure (ABFSS) in DataOS is typically created to build Lakehouse Resource. However, it can also be used to create a Depot Resource that requires secure access to ABFSS storage. The following sections outline the necessary permissions, configurations, and steps required to set up an Instance Secret efficiently.

## Pre-requisites

To create an Instance Secret for securing ABFSS credentials, you must have the following information:

### **Access Permissions in DataOS**

<aside class="callout">
🗣️ Note that tags and use cases may have varying access permissions depending on the organization.
</aside>

To create an Instance Secret in DataOS, at least one of the following role tags must be assigned:

- `roles:id:data-dev`

- `roles:id:system-dev`

- `roles:id:user`

    ```bash
        NAME     │     ID      │  TYPE  │        EMAIL         │              TAGS               
    ───────────────┼─────────────┼────────┼──────────────────────┼─────────────────────────────────
    Iamgroot     │   iamgroot  │ person │   iamgroot@tmdc.io   │ roles:id:data-dev,              
                    │             │        │                      │  roles:id:user,                  
                    │             │        │                      │ users:id:iamgroot  
    ```

**Checking Assigned Roles**

Use the following command to verify assigned roles:

```bash
dataos-ctl user get
```

If any required roles are missing, contact a DataOS Operator or submit a Grant Request for role assignment.

Alternatively, if access is managed through use cases, ensure the following use case is assigned:

- **Manage All Instance-level Resources of DataOS in User Layer**

    To validate assigned use cases, refer to the Bifrost Application Use Cases section.

    </center>


### **Source System Requirements**

- **Azure Endpoint Suffix:**

    The endpoint suffix for the Azure Storage account. This is typically region-specific and can be found in the Azure Portal under the Properties section of your storage account.

- **Azure Storage Account Key:**

    The access key for the Azure Storage account is used for authentication. You can retrieve this from the Azure Portal by navigating to your storage account, selecting Access keys under the Security + networking section, and copying the key.

- **Azure Storage Account Name:**

    The name of the Azure Storage account used to identify it within your subscription. This can be found in the Azure Portal under the Overview section of your storage account.

Ensure that you have these details ready before proceeding with the Instance Secret creation process.

## Create an Instance Secret for securing ABFSS credentials

Azure Blob File System Secure (ABFSS) is an object storage system. Object stores are distributed storage systems designed to store and manage large amounts of unstructured data.

To create an Azure Blob File System Secure (ABFSS) Instance Secret in DataOS, ensure you have access to the DataOS Command Line Interface (CLI) and the required permissions. Follow the steps below to complete the creation process efficiently and securely.

### **Step 1: Create a manifest file**

Begin by creating a manifest file to hold the configuration details for your ABFSS Instance Secret. Depending on your access needs (read-only or read-write), start with the corresponding YAML template provided below.

<aside class="callout">
🗣️ Note that for read-write access of an  Instance Secret the user has to create two Instance Secrets one with `acl:r` and other with `acl:rw` with similar names such as `abfssdepot-r `and` abfssdepot-rw`. If a user creates an Instance Secret with only read-write access and does not create a separate read-only Instance Secret, an error will be triggered while applying the Depot manifest file, as shown below.

    ```bash
    dataos-ctl apply -f /home/office/Depots/sf_depot.yaml
    INFO[0000] 🛠 apply...                                   
    INFO[0000] 🔧 applying testdepot:v2alpha:depot...        
    WARN[0000] 🔧 applying testdepot:v2alpha:depot...error   
    ⚠️ Invalid Parameter - failure validating instance resource : invalid depot, missing a secret reference with acl: r
    WARN[0000] 🛠 apply...error                              
    ERRO[0000] failure applying resources
    ```
</aside>

=== "Read-only instance-secret"

    ```yaml 
    # Azure Blob File System Secure (ABFSS) Read Instance Secret Manifest

    name: ${abfss-depot-name}-r # Name of the instance-secret, indicating it's for read-only access.
    version: v1 # Manifest Version           
    type: instance-secret # Resource-type
    description: ${description}   # Optional: Brief description of the instance-secret's purpose.
    layer: user # DataOS Layer                 
    instance-secret:
      type: key-value-properties  # Type of Instance-secret
      acl: r                     # Access control level, set to 'r' for read-only access.
      data:                       
        azureendpointsuffix: ${azure-endpoint-suffix}  # Endpoint suffix for the Azure storage account.
        azurestorageaccountkey: ${azure-storage-account-key}  # Access key for the Azure storage account.
        azurestorageaccountname: ${azure-storage-account-name}  # Name of the Azure storage account.
    ```

=== "Read-write instance-secret"

    ```yaml 
    # Azure Blob File System Secure (ABFSS) read-write Instance Secret Manifest

    name: ${abfss-depot-name}-rw  # Name of the instance-secret, indicating it's for read-write access.
    version: v1 # Manifest Version           
    type: instance-secret # Resource-type
    description: ${description}   # Optional: Brief description of the instance-secret's purpose.
    layer: user # DataOS Layer                 
    instance-secret:
      type: key-value-properties  # Type of Instance-secret
      acl: rw                     # Access control level, set to 'rw' for read-write access.
      data:                       
        azureendpointsuffix: ${azure-endpoint-suffix}  # Endpoint suffix for the Azure storage account.
        azurestorageaccountkey: ${azure-storage-account-key}  # Access key for the Azure storage account.
        azurestorageaccountname: ${azure-storage-account-name}  # Name of the Azure storage account.
    ```


**Resource meta section**

The ABFSS manifest includes a Resource meta section with essential metadata attributes common to all resource types. Some attributes in this section are optional, while others are mandatory. For more details, refer to the [configurations section](/resources/instance_secret/configurations/).

**Instance-secret specific section**

This section focuses on attributes specific to ABFSS Instance Secrets. It includes details like:

- `type`: Specifies the Instance Secret type (key-value-properties).

- `acl`: Access control level (read-only or read-write).

- `data`: Contains sensitive information such as Azure endpoint suffix, storage account key, and storage account name.

For more information, refer to the [configurations section](/resources/instance_secret/configurations/).
### **Step 2: Apply the manifest**

To create the ABFSS Instance Secret within DataOS, use the `apply` command. Since ABFSS Instance Secrets are Instance-level resources, do not specify a workspace while applying the manifest.

=== "Command"

    ```bash
    dataos-ctl resource apply -f ${manifest-file-path}
    ```
=== "Alternative Command"

    ```bash
    dataos-ctl apply -f ${manifest-file-path}
    ```

=== "Example Usage"

    ```bash
    dataos-ctl resource apply -f depot_secret.yaml
    Example usage:
    $ dataos-ctl apply -f depot_secret.yaml
    INFO[0000] 🛠 apply...                                   
    INFO[0000] 🔧 applying depotsecret-r:v1:instance-secret... 
    INFO[0004] 🔧 applying depotsecret-r:v1:instance-secret...created 
    INFO[0004] 🛠 apply...complete
    ```


### **Step 3: Validate the Instance Secret**

To validate the proper creation of the ABFSS Instance Secret in DataOS, use the `get` command.

=== "Command"

    ```bash
    dataos-ctl resource get -t instance-secret
    ```
=== "Expected Output"

    ```bash
    INFO[0000] 🔍 get...                                     
    INFO[0000] 🔍 get...complete                             

            NAME     | VERSION |      TYPE       | WORKSPACE | STATUS |  RUNTIME  |  OWNER             
    -----------------|---------|-----------------|-----------|--------|-----------|------------------------------
         depotsecret | v1      | instance-secret |           | active |           | iamgroot
    ```


To get the list of all the Instance Secret within the DataOS environment execute the following command.

=== "Command"

    ```bash
    dataos-ctl resource get -t instance-secret -a
    ```
=== "Expected Output"

    ```bash
    dataos-ctl resource get -t instance-secret -a
    INFO[0000] 🔍 get...                                     
    INFO[0000] 🔍 get...complete                             

                NAME            | VERSION |      TYPE       | WORKSPACE | STATUS | RUNTIME |         OWNER          
    ----------------------------|---------|-----------------|-----------|--------|---------|------------------------
     abfssv2alpha-r             | v1      | instance-secret |           | active |         | iamgroot       
     abfssv2alpha-rw            | v1      | instance-secret |           | active |         | iamgroot       
     abfsswithoutmetastore-r    | v1      | instance-secret |           | active |         | thisisthor              
     abfsswithoutmetastore-rw   | v1      | instance-secret |           | active |         | thisisthor              

    ```


Alternatively, you can also check on Metis UI by searching the Instance Secret by name.

## Delete the Instance Secret

<aside class="callout">
🗣️ Before you can delete an Instance Secret, you need to make sure there are no other Resources dependent on it. For example, if a Depot has a dependency on an Instance Secret, trying to delete that Instance Secret will cause an error. So, you'll need to remove the Depot first, and then you can delete the Instance Secret. This rule applies to not just Depot, but all dependent Resources, such as Workflow, Service, Worker, etc. The following error will be thrown if any Resource has a dependency on Instance Secret as shown below. Example usage:

    ```bash
    dataos-ctl delete -t instance-secret -n sampleinstsecret
    INFO[0000] 🗑 delete...                                  
    INFO[0000] 🗑 deleting sampleinstsecret:v1:instance-secret... 
    INFO[0001] 🗑 deleting sampleinstsecret:v1:instance-secret...error 
    WARN[0001] 🗑 delete...error                             
    ERRO[0001] Invalid Parameter - failure deleting instance resource : cannot delete resource, it is a dependency of 'depot:v2alpha:sampleinstdepot'
    ```
</aside>


To delete the ABFSS Instance Secret, use one of the following methods:

### **Method 1**

Specify the Resource type and Instance Secret name in the [`delete`](https://dataos.info/interfaces/cli/command_reference/#delete) command.

=== "Command"

    ```bash
    dataos-ctl resource delete -t ${resource-type} -n ${resource-name}
    ```
=== "Alternative Command"

    ```bash
    dataos-ctl delete -t ${resource-type} -n ${resource-name}
    ```
=== "Example Usage" 

    ```bash 
    dataos-ctl resource delete -t instance-secret -n sampleinstsecret
    Expected output:
    dataos-ctl delete -t instance-secret -n sampleinstsecret
    INFO[0000] 🗑 delete...                                  
    INFO[0000] 🗑 deleting sampleinstsecret:instance-secret...deleted
    INFO[0000] 🗑 delete...complete
    ```


### **Method 2**

Copy the Instance Secret name, version, and Resource-type from the output of the [`get`](https://dataos.info/interfaces/cli/command_reference/#get) command separated by '|' enclosed within quotes and use it as a string in the delete command.

=== "Command"

    ```bash
    dataos-ctl resource delete -i "${resource-name|version|resource-type}"
    ```
=== "Alternative Command"

    ```bash
    dataos-ctl delete -i "${resource-name|version|resource-type}"
    ```
=== "Example Usage"

    ```bash
    dataos-ctl delete -i "sfdepot01-r | v1      | instance-secret | public   "
    INFO[0000] 🗑 delete...                                  
    INFO[0000] 🗑 deleting sfdepot01-r:v1:instance-secret... 
    INFO[0000] 🗑 deleting sfdepot01-r:v1:instance-secret...deleted 
    INFO[0000] 🗑 delete...complete            
    ```


### **Method 3**

Specify the path of the manifest file and use the [`delete`](/interfaces/cli/command_reference/#delete) command.

=== "Command"

    ```bash
    dataos-ctl resource delete -f ${manifest-file-path}
    ```
=== "Alternative Command"

    ```bash
    dataos-ctl delete -f ${manifest-file-path}
    ```
=== "Example Usage"

    ```bash
    dataos-ctl delete -f /home/desktop/connect-city/instance_secret.yaml
    Expected output:
    INFO[0000] 🗑 delete...                                  
    INFO[0000] 🗑 deleting sampleinstsecret:instance-secret...deleted
    INFO[0000] 🗑 delete...complete
    ```
