# Getting Started - DataOS Documentation

Developing a complete understanding of a highly composable and modular infrastructure solution could take time and effort. That’s why we created this *Getting Started* document to help you consume information and develop an end-to-end understanding of DataOS core concepts, components - everything in and around it.

While making DataOps efficient for our users, we have also ensured that the users have complete control over how they want to effectuate DataOS - as an operational layer among their existing data infrastructure or to implement a new design/pattern like Data Mesh & Data Fabric. Some enterprises might choose to simply leverage DataOS’ capabilities of native governance, cataloging, and semantic layer, hence augmenting their existing tools and technology, while others might use it to manage their organisation’s entire data lifecycle. To understand how DataOS remains flexible enough to achieve this, you should go to
[About DataOS](../About%20DataOS/About%20DataOS.md).

If you are more interested in jumping into the specific stacks and components and learning their usage, you should soldier on to the links below. Since the way DataOS is leveraged can vary, the way you want to consume this document can change. For now, we have outlined two such ways; soon we will add more.


> ℹ️ Currently, the information is presented in two categories: Data Management Capabilities and Technology Stack. These two views hold identical information. Feel free to choose the view that’s consumable for you.
