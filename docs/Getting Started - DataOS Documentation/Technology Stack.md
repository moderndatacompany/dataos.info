# Technology Stack

Develop an understanding of different stacks, apps, components, and primitives, and how they interact with each other within the DataOS.
This will especially come in handy for tech users having a thorough understanding of data-tools & stacks.

The following page is designed to help you get accustomed to all the different components of DataOS as a whole.

## About DataOS

DataOS is designed to break data silos and enable democratized & secured access to trusted data across the organization.
Check out the documentation below to deepen your understanding. Read more on [About DataOS](../About%20DataOS/About%20DataOS.md).

## Interface

To explore DataOS, you can take any of the below-mentioned approaches depending on your role.

CLI 
    <br> 
    DataOS can be explored using the command line interface. Wait no more, simply install the shell and start using it.
    
- [CLI Installation](../CLI/CLI.md)
    
- [CLI Command Reference](../CLI/CLI%20Command%20Reference/CLI%20Command%20Reference.md)
    
GUI
    <br>
    Explore the graphical user interface and interact with the DataOS context with the set of inbuilt apps. This is a no-code interface. To learn more about it, simply visit the below page.

## Primitives

Primitives in DataOS are basic constructs to support various functionalities.
They can be used in combinations to solve any use cases and create workloads to extract intelligence from the data.
Being interoperable in nature, these primitives also use each other.

Refer to the [Primitives](../Primitives/Primitives.md) page to know more. Check the below pages for detailed documentation.
    
- [Cluster](../Primitives/Cluster/Cluster.md)
    
- [Compute](../Primitives/Compute/Compute.md)
    
- [Database](../Primitives/Database.md)
    
- [Depot](../Primitives/Depot/Depot.md)
    
- [Policy](../Primitives/Policy/Policy.md)
    
- [Service](../Primitives/Service/Service.md)
    
- [Secret](../Primitives/Secret.md)
