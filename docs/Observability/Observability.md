# Observability

Observability is a core pillar of DataOS. All data artefacts & the data itself are versioned by default. DataOS has observability layered across the entire data life cycle, which allows you to observe data ingestion, transformation, data governance, and resource utilization. It also allows you to set up governed alerts to address issues proactively.

# Data Observability

Check out Metis (Data Catalog): [Metis](Ontology/Metis.md) 

For lineage, check out: [Hera](Ontology/Hera.md) 

For knowledge graphs, visit: [Knowledge Graphs (Odin)](Ontology/Knowledge%20Graphs.md)

For quality & profiling: information coming soon!

# DataOps Observability

In order to inculcate DataOps concepts in practice, you need exhaustive monitoring and observability tool at all levels of the data life cycle. The separation of compute & storage optimizes cost and efficiency only if you can easily access the usage information and fine-tune your pods, nodes, clusters & virtual machines with expediency. DataOS has in-built tools to accomplish this. Check them out below: 

## Operations Center

DataOS provides you with a way to monitor all users, resources, workloads, services, nodes and more through
[Operations Center](Observability/Operations%20Center.md).

## Grafana

Grafana allows you to observe Kubernetes resource (compute & cluster-level resource) utilization with built-in dashboards. You can check this information on the GUI (under Operations Center) and even expose it as datasets with the use of Depot.
[Grafana Dashboard](Observability/Grafana%20Dashboard.md).
