# Snippets

Query snippets are segments of queries that you can reuse so that you don't need to write them from scratch while writing queries. They can be complete or part of the queries you want to use often. You can trigger/insert them using auto-complete.

This is particularly true for commonÂ `JOIN`Â statements, For example, a complicated join clause for the datasets, and it is being used frequently so you can create a snippet for it, and then while writing a new query, you can insert the content of the snippet in the query. 

## Create a Snippet

Clicking on +Add New will give you the following screen to add a new snippet. Provide a keyword for the trigger, which (if typed and tabbed) will be replaced with the entire snippet.
