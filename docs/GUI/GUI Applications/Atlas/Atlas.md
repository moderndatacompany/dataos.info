# Atlas

Atlas is an in-built BI solution that enables you to create customized reports/dashboards on any datasets with visualizations. The intuitive visualizations supported in DataOS help you understand complex data and derive insights to make important decisions. Choosing the right visualization helps you represent and interpret your data effectively. You can generate reports, visualize and track key KPIs, etc., to make informed marketing decisions that will eventually aid in campaign optimization, enhanced conversions, etc.

DataOS lets you supercharge your data with several other BI tools. To learn more about it, refer to [Integration and Ingestion](../../../Integration%20%26%20Ingestion/Integration%20%26%20Ingestion.md).
