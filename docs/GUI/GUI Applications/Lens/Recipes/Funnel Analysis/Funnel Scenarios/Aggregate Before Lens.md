## Additional Use Cases

- Count all calls that were submitted before a subscription was started to enrich your dataset (how many calls are required per subscription?
- Before making the first purchase, add to your dataset by using the COUNT DISTINCT of all Session ad sources (Was there a media mix before the first transaction?)
- Before an upgrade, add the SUM of the revenue to your dataset to improve it (does revenue affect propensity to upgrade?).
