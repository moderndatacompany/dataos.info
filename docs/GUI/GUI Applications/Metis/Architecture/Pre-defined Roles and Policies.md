# Pre-defined Roles and Policies

Metis supports defining roles and policies for metadata operations. AÂ User can be assignedÂ Roles. The policies define the set of permissions in the form of rules about what users can do with metadata, for example, whether users can only view metadata or update tags, add descriptions to data assets, change owners or create a glossary.

Once the Metis admin creates these roles and policies, roles can be assigned to users on Metis UI.

> ðŸ—£ You can contact the DataOS system administrator to assign you the â€˜adminâ€™ role from Metis UI. The system administrator can also give an admin role for Metis by adding `roles:direct:metis` tag to your DataOS user profile.

## Personas for Metis GUI

There is a direct 1-to-1 mapping between roles and policies, within further bifurcation in rules.

## Data Policies

| Policy | Description |
| --- | --- |

| `PII.income` | Incomes are grouped into buckets to represent different income ranges. An individual's income is redacted and anonymized with the lowest value in the bucket. |
| `PHI.date_of_birth` <br> `PII.date_of_birth` | Groups the date of births into buckets and redacts it to either(hour/day/week/month). By replacing the Date of Birth with the bucket's lower value, an individual's Date of Birth is hidden. |
| `PII.name` | Masks an individualâ€™s name by replacing it with a generated hash against the value. |
