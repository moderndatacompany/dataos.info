# Metis UI

Metis UI is a collaborative interface for diverse data users to navigate through the data ecosystem in an enterprise. Metis UI helps users search, discover, understand, and trust data assets that exist for the entire organization. Data assets include datasets, tables, columns,  dashboards, workflows, etc. Users can easily collaborate with other team members, inform them about the updates on the data assets, observe the changes in the metadata through versions and accomplish more. 

## Metis UI Homepage

Metis UI homepage displays all the activities around your data assets. You can navigate to the different pages by clicking on the Tabs given at the top. You can explore the data assets listed on the left panels.

## How to create Roles and Policies?

The Metis administrator has to decide on the roles users must be given along with the set of permissions for the roles. Permissions are a set of rules pertaining to various metadata operations that can be performed using Metis UI and APIs. These permissions are part of the policies corresponding to each role. When users are assigned roles, they automatically get the permissions defined for the roles. To know more, refer to
[Pre-defined Roles and Policies](../Architecture/Pre-defined%20Roles%20and%20Policies.md).


> ðŸ—£ Metis Admins have access to define newÂ roles and their associatedÂ permissions. Once roles and permissions are in line with organization/business requirements, Metis admin can assignÂ Roles toÂ Users.

## How to Add Configured Roles for Users

Roles can be assigned from the user profile on Metis UI.

1. On the Metis UI page, navigate to the Settings tab.
     
    <center>

> ðŸ—£ Metis Admin role can be given from the Metis UI by a user with â€˜Adminâ€™ privileges. You can also contact the DataOS system administrator to assign you the â€˜Adminâ€™ role by adding the `roles:direct:metis` tag to your DataOS user profile.


## How to Get Data Profile Information

Data profiling workflow analyzes the valid formats, null and inconsistent values within data to uncover anomalies and redundancies to achieve higher data quality. It uses basic statistics to gain insight about the validity of the data. The Data Profile scan workflow reads data profiling statistics and saves this information into Metis DB, which can be accessed on Metis UI.

1. Search the dataset for which you want to view the data profiling results.
2. On the data asset information page, click on the Profiler & Data Quality tab.
     
    <center>

    ![Asset information page](./Screen_Shot_2023-01-25_at_2.09.26_PM.png)

    </center>
        
    <figcaption align = "center">Asset information page</figcaption>
    <br>
    
3. You will see the data profiling statistics for the columns. It gives data types, null values %, distinct value %, and unique values % for each column. It also shows you â€˜value countâ€™, which helps you to know the completeness and missing values for the column before you use the data for critical business use cases.

## How to Get Fingerprinting Information

Fingerprinting analyzes the data to know that a column of data has a signature or a pattern. By examining the data values in a column, it can identify what type of data is there and determine what business terms or labels can be attached to this data. Fingerprinting automates identifying sensitive data (PII tag)that needs to be secured and to comply with government regulations like the GDPR. 

This information is shown on the Metis UI for your dataset.

On the data asset information page, you will see the following fingerprinting data.
    - Column names for which fingerprinting is performed.
    - Label showing the labels identified in the data. These labels are defined as system labels or according to business value.
    - For each label, you will get an option to accept the label to tag the fingerprint to the column or discard the label.
    - The confidence score reflects the system's degree of certainty that the identified label/classification is correct.
    - Once you accept the label, it will be added as a tag to the column.
