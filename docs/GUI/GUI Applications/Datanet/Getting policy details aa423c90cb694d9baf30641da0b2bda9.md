For example, a default PII policy is defined to protect sensitive information in your data. So, any column of any collection and dataset with dataos:f:pii tag is not visible to any user with tag dataos-user (default tag for all logged-in users) as the defined policy hashes the column values. But sometimes, you want some of the users to access this information. So the other policy is defined to override the default PII policy. Any column of any collection and dataset with the tag dataos:f:pii is visible to the user who has dataos:u:pii-reader tag.

5. For Filtering policies, Click on **Filter Policy**.
