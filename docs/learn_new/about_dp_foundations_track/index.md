## Core modules
The Foundations Track is split into two structured coursesâ€”each designed to walk you through the lifecycle of a Data Product. Each module within these courses covers key topics through step-by-step guidance, hands-on examples, and best practicesâ€”ensuring a clear and practical learning experience. This Foundations track keeps the content streamlined, emphasizing core concepts and guiding learners through one complete end-to-end example.

<aside class="callout">
ðŸ—£ This track features hands-on modules utilizing both the DataOS CLI and GUI. You'll use the CLI to apply YAML configurations and execute workflows. Concurrently, you'll navigate key DataOS graphical interfacesâ€”such as Workbench for querying data, Metis for metadata management, and the Data Product Hub (DPH) for overseeing data productsâ€”to gain comprehensive insights into the platform's capabilities.
