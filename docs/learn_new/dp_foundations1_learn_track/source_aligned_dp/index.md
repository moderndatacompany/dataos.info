# Source-Aligned Data Product
Raw data is often where every data journey beginsâ€”but in its untouched state, itâ€™s rarely fit for immediate use. While it holds valuable insights, raw data often comes with inconsistencies, missing values, and formatting issues that make it hard to trust, interpret, or act on.

Our **Retail Source-Aligned Data Product** unlocks the true value of customer, product, and sales data by cleaning, transforming, and governing itâ€”then making it accessible through an intuitive, self-service experience. The result? Trusted, high-quality data thatâ€™s ready for exploration, analysis, and downstream consumption.

## ðŸ’¡ What Is a Source-aligned Data Product?

A **Source-Aligned Data Product** (also known as an **Entity-First Data Product**) is a curated, high-quality version of data that closely mirrors the structure and behavior of its source systemâ€”but with a critical difference: it's cleaned, validated, and made fit for purpose.

These products preserve the original dataâ€™s granularity and lineage while enforcing strict quality checks such as completeness, accuracy, and consistency. They're built to serve as trustworthy foundations for analytics, dashboards, and more advanced data products.
