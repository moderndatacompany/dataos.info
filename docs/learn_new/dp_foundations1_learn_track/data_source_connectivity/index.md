# Source Data Connectivity

!!! info "Overview"
    Before you can build a Data Product, you need to connect to the data itself. In this module, you’ll learn how to configure **Depots** in DataOS—your gateway to accessing external data sources securely.

---

## 📘 Scenario

Your team is expanding its use of DataOS and needs to integrate multiple data sources into the platform. Using **Depots**, you can establish secure connections to these data sources, enhancing data interoperability while keeping the data securely in place. This approach not only preserves data security but also facilitates interaction with various DataOS Resources.

---

## Quick concepts 

The **Depot Resource** in DataOS provides a standardized way to connect to a variety of enterprise data sources, such as:

- Cloud-based object stores
- Databases
- Data warehouses
- NoSQL data stores

Depots allow you to:

- Build high-quality data pipelines  
- Query data efficiently using query clusters  
- Support semantic modeling for better data understanding

---

## Prerequisites

Before diving into configuring data source connections, make sure you have everything ready:

1. **Check required permissions**  
   Ensure you have the necessary roles assigned (data-dev, system-dev, and operator) to create and manage data products in DataOS. In DataOS, roles are defined with specific tags such as data-dev, system-dev, and operator. These tags determine the permissions and access levels for users.

      | **Access Permission (via use-cases)** | **Access Permissions (via tags)** |
      |--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
      | Read Workspace                       | `roles:id:data-dev`               |
      | Manage All Depot                     | `roles:id:system-dev`             |
      | Read All Dataset                     | `roles:id:user`                   |
      | Read all secrets from Heimdall       | *(Not specified)*                 |
   
      To check this, login to DataOS and view your profile. You can verify the assigned roles by checking the associated tags.

      🗣️ Some tasks require specific permissions typically assigned to DataOS Operators. Contact DataOS administartor or training team for 'Operator' tag.

2. **Check CLI installation**  
   You need this text-based interface that allows you to interact with the DataOS context via command prompts.  
   Open a command terminal and follow the [installation guide](/interfaces/cli/installation/) for your operating system. Once the installation is complete, proceed with the initialization.

3. **DataOS context initialization & login**  
   After successful installation of `dataos-ctl`, let's initialize and log in to the DataOS context using CLI.

     **a. Open terminal**

     **b. Type:**
     ```bash
     dataos-ctl init
     ```

     **c. Follow the prompts and provide inputs depending on your user role:**
     ```bash
     INFO[0000] The DataOS® is already initialized, do you want to add a new context? (Y,n)  
     -> Y   # input the answer: Y or n

     INFO[0255] 🚀 initialization...

     INFO[0255] The DataOS® is not initialized, do you want to proceed with initialization? (Y,n)  
     -> Y

     INFO[0269] Please enter a name for the current DataOS® Context?  
     -> {{name of the DataOS context}}
     # Example: marmot (or any name you prefer).
     # Your enterprise may offer multiple contexts — pick one to start.
     # You can switch context anytime using a CLI command after login.

     INFO[0383] Please enter the fully qualified domain name of the DataOS® instance?  
     -> {{domain name}} 
     # Example: apparent-marmot.dataos.app

     INFO[0408] Entered DataOS®: marmot : apparent-marmot.dataos.app 

     INFO[0429] Are you operating the DataOS®? (Y,n)         
     -> n  
     # If you are the operator (admin) for your enterprise, type Y.
     # If you type Y, the installation steps will change.

     INFO[0452] 🚀 initialization...complete
     ```

     **d. Now, log in:**
     ```bash
     dataos-ctl login
     ```

     Output:
     ```bash
     INFO[0000] 🔑 login...                                   
     INFO[0000] 🔑 refresh...                                 
     INFO[0003] authorize...                                 
     INFO[0004] authorize...complete                         
     INFO[0004] 🔑 refresh...complete                         
     INFO[0004] 🔑 login...complete 
     ```

     **e. Verify the CLI installation:**
     ```bash
     dataos-ctl version
     dataos-ctl health
     ```

4. **Install any IDE, such as Visual Studio Code**  
   This is necessary for creating YAML files for your Data Product. Installation links for various operating systems are provided below:

    - **Linux**: [Install VS Code on Linux](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/linux)  
    - **Windows**: [Install VS Code on Windows](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/windows)  
    - **macOS**: [Install VS Code on macOS](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac)

## Checklist

- ✅  CLI is installed 
- ✅  CLI is initialized and logged in
- ✅  IDE (like VS Code) is installed
