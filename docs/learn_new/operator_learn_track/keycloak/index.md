# Adding users to Keycloak

Managing user access is a key aspect of system administration in Keycloak. This guide explains how to create and manage users within the Keycloak Admin Console, ensuring seamless user onboarding.

## ðŸ“˜ Scenario

Youâ€™re responsible for onboarding a new team member to your organizationâ€™s system. To provide them secure access, you need to create their user profile in Keycloak. With administrative access, you navigate to the Users section in the Keycloak Admin Console. Using the Create User option, you set up user profile to access the system confidently and securely.

## Prerequisite

Before proceeding, ensure you must have administrative access to the 'Keycloak Admin Console' to create and manage users.

## Steps to follow

1. **Navigate to the Users Section:** In the left-hand navigation menu of the 'Keycloak Admin Console', click on **Users**. This will bring up the user management screen.
2. **Create a New User:** Click on the 'Create User' button at the top-right corner of the user list. This will direct you to a form where you can enter the new user's details.
3. **Fill in User Details:** On the 'Create User' form, you need to provide the following information for the new user:
    - **Required user actions: Specify any actions the user must complete before logging in. Once a required action is completed, the user will not need to perform it again in the future. For example, the Update Password action requires the user to change their password upon the first login.
    - **Email**: The user's email address (this is a required field).
    - **First Name**: The user's first name.
    - **Last Name**: The user's last name.
