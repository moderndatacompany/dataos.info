# Create a Scanner Workflow

After establishing a secure connection using a Depot, the next step is to validate that connection by creating and running a Scanner Workflow. This allows you to extract metadata from the connected data source and make it available for query within DataOS‚Äîwithout needing to ingest the data.

üìò Scenario

Let‚Äôs say your sales data lives in a purchase table in a PostgreSQL database. Once the Postgres Depot is configured, you can scan its metadata to inspect table structures and immediately begin querying it in Workbench, all without copying or moving the data.

## Quick concepts

‚Å†The Scanner Stack in DataOS is a metadata extraction framework that ingests metadata from external source systems connected via Depot (RDBMS, cloud-based warehouses, etc.). The Scanner enables the extraction of both high-level metadata such as dataset or table names, including table schemas, column names, and descriptions (if available in the data).

üó£
Scanner is not supported for object storage systems (e.g., S3), as they are file-based and do not expose table-level metadata. Supported sources include RDBMS systems and cloud warehouses.

## Creating a Scanner Workflow

Depots are used to connect to metadata sources to extract entities' metadata. To scan all datasets from the data source referenced by the Depot:

- Provide the Depot name or address to establish a connection

- Configure and apply a Scanner Workflow YAML

### **Step 1: Define Your Scanner Workflow YAML**

Create a file named scanner.yaml and define your Scanner Workflow using the following template:

```yaml
# Important: Replace 'xx' with your initials to personalize and distinguish the resource you‚Äôve created.
version: v1
name: wf-postgres-depot-xx
type: workflow
workflow:
  dag:
    - name: postgres-depot
      description: Scans schema tables in Postgres
      spec:
        stack: scanner:2.0
        compute: runnable-default
        stackSpec:
          depot: dataos://postgres        # name of the Depot
```

### **Step 2: Apply the Workflow YAML**

Use the CLI to apply the Scanner Workflow:

```bash
dataos-ctl apply -f <scanner_workflow yaml file>
```

### **Step 3: Test the successful deployment**

Check the Operations app for the status of your workflow. If it fails, review the logs and debug as needed.

## Verify Metadata in Metis

1. Go to the Metis app.

2. Search for the schema or table name scanned or you can navigate to the Assets > Datasets section.

3. Verify metadata fields like column names, data types, sample values, etc.

## Explore Data in Workbench

<aside class="callout">
üó£

Contact the administrator to confirm if a cluster is set up for you, then select the assigned cluster.

</aside>

1. Confirm the DevOps team has added your Depot to the correct Cluster

2. Open the Workbench app and select your Cluster

3. Navigate through Catalog > Schema > Table

4. Write a SQL query using the scanned metadata

5. Click Run and review the query results

You can now explore source data using SQL without ingestion‚Äîthanks to the metadata discovered through scanning.


## Next step

With Depot in place, you are now ready to build data pipelines to deliver reliable data for your data products ensuring seamless data flow.
