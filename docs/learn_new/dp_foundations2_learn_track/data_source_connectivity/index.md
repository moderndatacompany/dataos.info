# Source Data Connectivity

Before you can build a data product, you need to connect to the data itself. In this module, youâ€™ll learn how to configure **Depots** in DataOSâ€”your gateway to accessing external data sources securely, without needing to move the data.

---

ðŸŽ¯ You've already covered source connectivity in the **Foundations Track 1**.

If your connections to raw and target systems are already set up, feel free to skip ahead. But if you need a refresher or want to double-check your setup, revisit the modules below:

ðŸ‘‰ [Review: Source Connectivity](/learn_new/dp_foundations1_learn_track/data_source_connectivity/)

ðŸ‘‰ [Review: Setting Up Depots](/learn_new/dp_foundations1_learn_track/data_source_connectivity/setting_up_depots/)

## âœ… Checklist:

- [ ]  CLI is installed 
- [ ]  CLI is initialized and logged in
- [ ]  IDE (like VS Code) is installed
