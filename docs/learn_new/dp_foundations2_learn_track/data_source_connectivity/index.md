# Source Data Connectivity

!!! info "Overview"
    In this module, rather than creating new Depots, you'll utilize the existing source-aligned Data Product established in the previous course of the foundations track. This Data Product exposes three curated datasetsâ€”customer_data, product_data, and purchase_dataâ€”that have been processed and structured for your use case. These datasets serve as reliable inputs for building semantic models, and consumer-aligned Data Products.

## Checklist

Before moving on to the next module, ensure that:

- âœ…  CLI is installed 
- âœ…  CLI is initialized and logged in
- âœ…  IDE (like VS Code) is installed

# Next step
Ready to move forward? Head to the next module where you'll build Flare workflows to apply complex transformations to create output datasets that fuel the analytics need for your use case.
