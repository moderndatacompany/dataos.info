## 🌟 What You’ll Learn

By the end of this course, you’ll be able to:

- **Define Business-Centric Data Products**  
  Capture use case requirements, KPIs, and metrics that guide the design of meaningful data products.

- **Model, Transform, and Secure Data**  
  Build semantic models, apply business logic, and implement access control to ensure secure, governed consumption.

- **Enable Consumption Across Tools**  
  Expose outputs via semantic models and APIs for seamless use in BI tools, notebooks, and apps.

## Scenario: Your Mission

You’re continuing work on the **Retail Data Product**, and now it’s time to make it usable for business consumers. Your data team has cleaned and organized raw inputs—but now the focus shifts to creating semantic layers, applying business logic, and enabling access through secure endpoints and tools like Lens and GraphQL.

**Your goal?** Build a **consumer-aligned data product** that transforms structured data into insights. You’ll define business rules, model key metrics, and expose them in the right formats for business teams.
