# ðŸ”Œ Source Data Connectivity

Before you can build a data product, you need to connect to the data itself. In this module, youâ€™ll learn how to configure **Depots** in DataOSâ€”your gateway to accessing external data sources securely, without ever needing to move the data.

---

## ðŸ“˜ Scenario

Your team is scaling its use of DataOS and needs to integrate multiple data sources into the platform. With **Depots**, you can establish secure, read-only connections to these sources, enabling smooth access and governanceâ€”all while keeping the data in place.

This setup not only preserves data security but also improves interoperability and allows you to interact with various DataOS resources like Workbench, Scanner, and Flare.

## ðŸ§  Quick Concepts: What Are Depots?

The **Depot Resource** in DataOS is a standardized way to connect to enterprise data sources, such as:

- Cloud object stores  
- Relational databases  
- Data warehouses  
- NoSQL systems

Depots allow you to:

- Build high-quality data pipelines  
- Query data efficiently using query clusters  
- Support semantic modeling for better data understanding

## âœ… Prerequisites

Before setting up depots, ensure the following tools and permissions are in place:

### 1. **Permissions Checklist**

Some setup tasks require elevated access, usually assigned to DataOS Operators. You should have one of these:

| Access via Use Case                | Access via Tag             |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Read Workspace                    | `roles:id:data-dev`        |
| Manage All Depot                  | `roles:id:system-dev`      |
| Read All Dataset                  | `roles:id:user`            |
| Read all secrets from Heimdall    | _(To be filled if needed)_ |

### 2. **Install the DataOS CLI**

The CLI gives you command-line access to your DataOS environment.

- [Install the CLI](/interfaces/cli/installation/)

---

### 3. **Initialize and Log In to the CLI**

Once installed, initialize your CLI context and log in:

#### a. Open your terminal and run:
```bash
dataos-ctl init
```
