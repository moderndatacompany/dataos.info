## Developing Data Products with DataOS

The development of a data product in **DataOS** follows a structured lifecycle:

1. **Design**: Define business goals and translate them into a solution architecture.

2. **Develop**: Build and test the data product based on the design.

3. **Deploy**: Release the product to users and ensure it operates effectively in a production environment.

4. **Iterate**: Continuously improve the product through feedback and performance analysis.

5. **Deprecate**: Gradually retire the data product when it is no longer needed, ensuring users are informed, dependencies are removed, and resources are cleaned up safely.


## DataOS building blocks (Resources)

DataOS offers a rich set of building blocks, known as Resources, that enable the core capabilities of a modern data stack.

These Resources are organized by the key capabilities they support within DataOS, helping users understand how each contributes to building, managing, and consuming data products.
