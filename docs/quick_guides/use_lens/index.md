# Using Lens

!!! info "Information"
    Lens is a powerful tool within DataOS that allows you to explore and analyze your data with ease. Follow this comprehensive guide to learn how to make the most out of Lens.

Let's consider an example in the context of a retail company to analyze customer data to optimize its product offerings and marketing strategies.

We will use one example Lens **Sportsdata** for the scenario to gain insights into the most frequent orders for a specific brand, understand the product category share order by year and conduct date-wise order analysis. We also want to analyze customer dissatisfaction and issues with product quality and services, so we will need records of purchased item returns.

Before you start exploring Lens to find answers to your queries, let us quickly understand the key data elements used throughout this guide.

**Entities**: Fundamental business concepts analyzed in data, such as Retailer, Order, and Product. They are the subjects or actors in the data.

**Fields**: Data elements within entities, like retailer_id or product_id, providing specific information. They are columns that uniquely identify an entity.

**Dimensions**: Categorical attributes contextualizing measures, like order_date or product_category, for varied analysis.

**Measures**: Quantitative values for analysis, such as total_sales or average_customer_age, derived from fields and dimensions.

**Relationships**: Connections between entities, simplifying queries across multiple data sets through defined associations.

## Building Query for Analysis

Next, let's dive into the analysis of date-wise orders.

Open¬†**Lens Explorer**, where you will find a list of entities along with their fields, dimensions, and measures.

![sportsdata_lensexplorer.png](/quick_guides/use_lens/sportsdata_lensexplorer.png)

### **Step 1: Select a Cluster**

- If a cluster is not selected, choose the appropriate cluster to start querying Lens.
    
    ![cluster_selection.png](/quick_guides/use_lens/cluster_selection.png)
    

### **Step 2: Choose Fields, Dimensions, and Measures**

1. Explore entities to understand available fields, dimensions, and measures. 
2. Choose the required fields for your analysis based on your use case.
    
    For the most frequent order analysis, we will select customer_key(from the **Customer** entity) and number of orders (from **Sales** entity). Once you have found the required field, click on the field name. Once selected, the field name will become highlighted in grey. This will automatically populate the field as a column in the table.
    
    ![select_fields.png](/quick_guides/use_lens/select_fields.png)
    
3. Click on the information icon for detailed descriptions and logic behind calculated fields if applicable.

    ![total_ravenue.png](/quick_guides/use_lens/total_ravenue.png)
    

### **Step 3: Apply Filter Conditions**

Add filter rules to narrow down the dataset based on specific conditions.

1. Click on the "**Filter**" option to open the filter panel.
2. Identify the field you want to filter by. It could be any **dimension** or **measure** within your Lens.
3. Click on the ‚ÄúAdd rule‚Äù.
4. Select the field.
5. Once the field is added to the filter panel, you'll be prompted to define the condition.
    - Choose the appropriate operator (e.g., equals, greater than, less than) based on your filtering requirement.
    - Enter the value or range for the condition.
6. You can add more rules with AND , OR operators.
    
    Here, we aim to analyze customers based on their occupation and income group.
    
    ![add_rule.png](/quick_guides/use_lens/add_rule.png)
    
7. We can create Group conditions for complex filtering requirements.
    
    **Example 1**: If you're looking to compile a list of female customers who either hold managerial positions with an income exceeding 5000 or are professionals with an annual income surpassing 1000, we can filter the dataset accordingly.
    
    In this situation, you will use Add groups while adding rules.
    
    ![add_group.png](/quick_guides/use_lens/add_group.png)
    
8. Set sorting order and limit the number of records as required.
    
    You can choose the sorting order and limit the number of records in the user interface.
