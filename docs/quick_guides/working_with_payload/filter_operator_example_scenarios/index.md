## 2. `notEquals`

The opposite operator of `equals`. It supports multiple values.

- Applied to measures.
- Dimension types: `string`, `number`, `time`.

**Example Payload**

**Result**

## 3. `contains`

The `contains` filter functions as a wildcard, case-insensitive LIKE operator. It typically utilizes the ILIKE operator in SQL backends, with values enclosed in `%`. This filter supports multiple values.

- Dimension types: `string`.

## 5. `startsWith`

The `startsWith` filter acts as a case-insensitive `LIKE` operator with a wildcard at the end. Supports multiple values.

- Dimension types: `string`.

**Example Payload and Result**

This query retrieves up to 10 product IDs and their associated designer names, filtering for designers whose names start with "Ja."

## 6. `notStartsWith`

The opposite operator of `startsWith`.

**Example Payload and Result**

This query retrieves up to 10 product IDs and their associated designer names, filtering for designers whose names do not start with "Ja."

## 7. `endsWith`

The `endsWith` filter acts as a case-insensitive `LIKE` operator with a wildcard at the beginning. Supports multiple values.

- Dimension types: `string`.

**Example Payload and Result**

This query retrieves up to 10 product IDs and their associated designer names, filtering for designers whose names end with "e.‚Äù

- Applied to measures.
- Dimension types: `number`.

**Example Payload and Result**

- Applied to measures.
- Dimension types: `number`.

**Example Payload and Result**

## 13. `set`

Operator `set` checks whether the value of the member **is not** `NULL`. You don't need to pass `values` for this operator.

- Applied to measures.
- Dimension types: `number`, `string`, `time`.

**Example Payload and Result**

The query retrieves products where the price information is not missing (NOT NULL).

- Applied to measures.
- Dimension types: `number`, `string`, `time`.

**Example Payload and Result**

The query retrieves products where the price information is missing (NULL).
