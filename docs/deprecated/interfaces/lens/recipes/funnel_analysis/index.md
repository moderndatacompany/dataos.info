# Funnel Analysis

Funnel analysis helps businesses trace usersâ€™ journeys as they perform a series of activities that lead toward a defined goal. It helps investigate the activities performed by users, estimates the duration it takes for a user to perform an activity, tracks conversion time from one activity to another, and much more. It is essentially analyzing your core customer activities over time.

To enable funnel analysis, we will be using the Activity Schema. Activity schema makes it reasonably simple to perform funnel analysis, given the complexity of building more straightforward funnels through SQL.

> ðŸ—£ Points to Consider

1. Base entity â€˜activity streamâ€™ is connected to Entity 1 and has a 1:N relationship with Entity 1
2. Base entity â€˜activity streamâ€™ is extended to create Entity 1 and Entity 2

Letâ€™s deep dive into different funnel analysis scenarios
