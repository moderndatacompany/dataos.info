# Data Product Owner Track

!!! info "Overview"
    Welcome to the DataOS Owner learning track! In DataOS, a data product owner must oversee the entire journey of a data product, from its initial design and deployment to its eventual deprecation.This track equips you to define, manage, and evolve Data Products that align with business goals, deliver measurable value, and stay governed throughout their lifecycle.

## Who this track is for

| **Persona**                     | **Why It Matters**                                                                                                                             | **Level**      |
|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| **Data Product Owners / Managers** | Drive product lifecycle, value delivery, and cross-functional alignment. Gain practical tools to manage strategy, quality, and usage.           | Must-have      |
| **Technical Leads / Architects**  | Understand ownership principles to better support product design, governance enforcement, and delivery architecture.                            | Recommended    |


## What you will learn

Gain the skills and mindset to drive strategic data product outcomes across the lifecycle.

- **Define & evolve Data Products**: Learn how to define purpose, outcomes, and success criteriaâ€”and evolve products based on feedback and business needs.

- **Ensure metadata completeness**: Understand how to maintain accurate, complete metadata for lineage, ownership, classification, and discoverability.

- **Oversee data quality**: Monitor and enforce quality standards using profiling, validation, and cleansing techniques.

- **Enforce governance & compliance**: Apply policies for role-based access, data privacy, and regulatory frameworks (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).

- **Drive adoption with usage insights**: Analyze product usage, prioritize improvements, and track performance to ensure relevance and value.

- **Manage cost & efficiency**: Monitor compute and storage consumption, optimize resources, and align with budgetary goals.

- **Operationalize reliability**: Configure alerts and response workflows to ensure timely detection and resolution of data product issues.
