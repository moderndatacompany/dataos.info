# Configuring Alerts grafana

This topic details the steps to configure alerts for key performance indicators and troubleshooting performance issues.

## Scenario

Imagine you're responsible for ensuring the reliability of a critical application in DataOS. Your job is to monitor the system for any signs of issues, such as unexpected traffic spikes, high CPU usage, or incoming alerts that indicate something might be wrong. To do this effectively, you need a tool that lets you visualize whatâ€™s happening within your system in real-time.

## Grafana as observability tool

In DataOS, Grafana helps you track the health and performance of your systems by creating visual dashboards. Grafana gathers data from Prometheus, a monitoring system that collects time-series metrics (like CPU usage, memory consumption, or alert counts) about your infrastructure. This setup allows you to see trends, spot unusual patterns, and respond to issues before they impact users.
