# DataOS Operator Learning Track

This track is designed to empower you with the expertise to manage, optimize, and ensure the reliability of the DataOS platform.

By the end of this course, you'll be able to:

- **Secure platform operations**: Implement credential security and access management practices to protect sensitive data and enforce proper access control.

- **Establish and maintain connectivity**: Configure secure, stable connections to data sources while adhering to best practices for security.

- **Monitor and optimize performance**: Use system metrics, routine checks, and query cluster management to ensure seamless data access and platform efficiency.

- **Manage platform upgrades**: Plan, execute, and roll back platform upgrades confidently, minimizing downtime and maintaining operational stability.

- **Proactively resolve issues**: Leverage monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana to detect and address issues before they impact the platform.

- **Enforce precise access control**: Manage user roles and permissions to ensure data security while enabling efficient collaboration within the DataOS platform.

## Module 1: Credential security

As a DataOS Operator, you are responsible for safeguarding sensitive information by managing credentials securely within the DataOS platform. Learn to implement best practices, ensuring the system remains secure.
