# User

## Scenario

As a DataOS Operator, you manage users within Bifrost and ensure they have access to necessary resources by assigning appropriate roles and policies. Recently, your data engineering team requested access to manage Depot within DataOS. You have already created a policy for the `data-dev` role; now, you will assign this role to your organization's data engineers to give them access to the Depot. 

Before assigning a role to each user, you should explore the User tab in the Bifrost.

In Bifrost, the Users tab displays a list of users accessing DataOS. Users can be categorized into two types: person and application. New users can be added by clicking the Create User button, but keep in mind the following:

- **Application users** can only be added directly through Bifrost.
- **Person-type users** require access to your organization‚Äôs Active Directory (AD) before being added.

üó£Ô∏è If you add a person as a new user through Bifrost without first including them in your organization‚Äôs AD, it will create an empty user who cannot perform any actions.
