# Data Product Foundations Track: Course II

!!! info "Overview"
    Welcome to the second course of the Data Product Foundations Track! In this hands-on journey, you'll build a **consumer-aligned data product** that transforms raw data into structured, business-ready insights for reporting, dashboards, and self-service analytics.

---

## ðŸŒŸ What youâ€™ll learn

By the end of this course, youâ€™ll be able to:

- **Define business-centric Data Products**  
  Capture use case requirements, KPIs, and metrics that guide the design of meaningful data products.

- **Model, transform, and secure data**  
  Build semantic models, apply business logic, and implement access control to ensure secure, governed consumption.

- **Enable consumption across tools**  
  Expose outputs via semantic models and APIs for seamless use in BI tools, notebooks, and apps.

- **Package and deploy your Data Product**  
  Bundle your resources, define the spec, and register your product in Data Product Hub and Metis.

## ðŸ“˜ Scenario

Youâ€™re continuing work on the **Retail Data Product**, and now itâ€™s time to make it usable for business consumers. Your data team has cleaned and organized raw inputsâ€”but now the focus shifts to creating semantic layers, applying business logic, and enabling access through secure endpoints and tools like Lens and GraphQL.

**Your goal?** Build a **consumer-aligned data product** that transforms structured data into insights. Youâ€™ll define business rules, model key metrics, and expose them in the right formats for business teams.

## ðŸ“š Learning modules

### **Module 1: Define Business Requirements**

To create a successful Data Product, itâ€™s crucial to first understand the business context and requirements. This module focuses on capturing key needs and expectations for Data Products for your organization based on Righ to Left approach:

## How to use these modules

Each module in this track is designed for self-paced, hands-on learning.

To follow along:

1. Open your preferred code editor and create a new file with a `.yaml` extension.

2. Based on your objective (e.g., creating a data pipeline, configuring access policies), copy the relevant YAML snippets provided in the training materials.

3. Modify the snippets as needed to suit your use caseâ€”update names, paths, and credentials as appropriate.

4. Login to your DataOS training instance via the CLI.

5. Use the `dataos-ctl apply` command to deploy and test your changes.

> Each section includes specific instructions and configuration details to guide you through the process.
