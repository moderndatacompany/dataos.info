# Create Monitor and Pager for quality checks 

In this module, you'll learn how to configure Monitor and Pager resources in DataOS to proactively detect data quality check failures and send real-time alerts to your team. This ensures faster incident response and improves the overall reliability of your Data Products.

---

## Scenario



> ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: A workflow must be set up to sink SodaStream incidents into the Lakehouse for this monitor to function correctly. Contact your training team to verify this setup.

## What You'll Do

1. Review and understand a sample Monitor configuration for Soda quality checks.

2. Configure a Pager to send alerts (e.g., via Microsoft Teams webhook).

3. Update the webhook URL and customize identifiers as needed.



1. Review the template to understand how a quality checks monitor is configured.
2. Review the template to understand how a quality checks pager is configured. Ensure you update the webhook URL.

**üìú Templates:**

- **Quality Checks Monitor**
    
    ```yaml
    **# Important:** Replace 'xx' with your initials to personalize and distinguish the resource you‚Äôve created.

                }
              ]
            }
    
    ```
    
    > **Important Note:** This pager is designed to receive alerts triggered by the quality-checks-alerts monitor. Full implementation depends on the SodaStream incident workflow being in place. Contact your training team to confirm it.

## Checklist

- [ ]  Check the schedule defined in the Monitor YAML.
- [ ]  Review the conditions and bodyTemplate in the pager manifest.
- [ ]  Update the URL in the webhook section with the actual webhook URL.

## Next Step

With monitors and pagers in place for quality checks, it's time to bundle all your components, define the Data Product specification, and register it in the Data Product Hub.
