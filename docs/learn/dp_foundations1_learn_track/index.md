# Data Product Foundations Track: Course I 

!!! info "Overview"
    In this course, you'll learn how to build a **source-aligned Data Product** from the ground up. By following each step and completing the checklists, youâ€™ll learn how to connect, ingest, and shape source data into a product-ready asset on DataOS.

---

## ðŸŒŸ What youâ€™ll learn

By the end of this course, youâ€™ll be able to:

- **Create source-aligned Data Products**  
  Understand the concepts and build a working Data Product using DataOS.

- **Connect, explore, and ingest Data**  
  Use depots to connect with source systems, explore external data using Scanner and Workbench, and build Flare workflows for ingestion and transformation.

- **Define data quality and set up monitoring**  
  Define SLOs, run Soda quality checks, and configure monitors and pagers for reliable, observable data workflows.

- **Deploy and register Data Products**  
  Package your work into a bundle, create the Data Product spec, deploy it, and make it searchable in the Data Product Hub.

## ðŸ“˜ Scenario

Youâ€™re part of a retail companyâ€™s data team. Youâ€™ve been asked to build a **Retail Data Product** that makes customer, product, and sales data clean, trusted, and usable for dashboards, analytics, and future Data Products. Right now, this raw data is scattered across databases and blob storageâ€”messy, inconsistent, and full of nulls and duplicates.

**Your goal?** Build a **source-aligned Data Product** that keeps the raw structure but makes the data usable. Youâ€™ll apply quality checks, transform formats, enforce governance, and organize it around real business entities and make them available for the downstream use.

## How to use these modules

Each module in this track is designed for self-paced, hands-on learning.

To follow along:

1. Open your preferred code editor and create a new file with a `.yaml` extension.

2. Based on your objective (e.g., creating a data pipeline, configuring access policies), copy the relevant YAML snippets provided in the training materials.

3. Modify the snippets as needed to suit your use caseâ€”update names, paths, and credentials as appropriate.

4. Login to your DataOS training instance via the CLI.

5. Use the `dataos-ctl apply` command to deploy and test your changes.

> Each section includes specific instructions and configuration details to guide you through the process.

## Checklist for success

Make sure you complete the following:

- âœ… CLI installed and initialized  
- âœ… Depot manifests created using Instance Secrets  
- âœ… Data explored via Workbench and metadata viewed in Metis  
- âœ… Ingestion pipelines built and verified  
- âœ… SLOs defined and implemented using SodaCL  
- âœ… Quality monitored in Metis with SLO trends and alerts  
- âœ… Data Product deployed and visible to intended users
