# Source Data Connectivity

!!! info "Overview"
    Before you can build a Data Product, you need to connect to the data itself. In this module, you’ll learn how to configure **Depots** in DataOS—your gateway to accessing external data sources securely.

---

## 📘 Scenario

Your team is expanding its use of DataOS and needs to integrate multiple data sources into the platform. Using **Depots**, you can establish secure connections to these data sources, enhancing data interoperability while keeping the data securely in place. This approach not only preserves data security but also facilitates interaction with various DataOS Resources.

---

## Quick concepts 

The **Depot Resource** in DataOS provides a standardized way to connect to a variety of enterprise data sources, such as:

- Cloud-based object stores
- Databases
- Data warehouses
- NoSQL data stores

Depots allow you to:

- Build high-quality data pipelines  
- Query data efficiently using query clusters  
- Support semantic modeling for better data understanding

## Next step
You’re now ready to configure depots and start connecting to your source systems.
