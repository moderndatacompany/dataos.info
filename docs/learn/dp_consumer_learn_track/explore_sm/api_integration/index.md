# Integration with API

!!! info "Overview"
    The Integration feature for your Data Product, allows developer teams to programmatically access system dataâ€”specific metrics, filtered datasets, or targeted subsetsâ€”directly through APIs. This is ideal for applications requiring automation, data embedding, or on-demand querying.

## ðŸ“˜ Scenario 

While exploring the semantic model in the Studio feature, a developer needs to retrieve the total number of customers by country to power an internal analytics dashboard. They select the appropriate measure and dimension to analyze customer distribution across regions. Once the data is reviewed in Studio on Data Product Hub, the developer decides to integrate it programmatically into their application to support automated and dynamic reporting.

## Integration options

For teams needing to fetch data programmatically, the 'Integration' tab provides options:

Letâ€™s assume you need to fetch the 'total number of customers by country'. Rather than building REST endpoints, you can efficiently query the data using a `curl` command, `GraphQL`, or `Postgres`, depending on your preference. These methods allow you to retrieve data from a given endpoint and present it in a user-friendly format within your application.

First, select the following dimensions and measures:

- `total_customers`
- `country`

### **Using Curl**

To access your data over HTTP using `curl`, follow these steps:

1. **Copy the `curl` Command**
    
    Go to the 'Integration' section and choose 'Curl' option. Copy the provided Curl command and paste it into your terminal.

2. **Replace Placeholder**
You will notice a placeholder for `<api_key>` in the command. Replace it with your actual API key. This will allow you to fetch the required data for integration into your application.

### **Using GraphQL**

GraphQL is another option for querying data over HTTP. 

To use GraphQL:

1. Select 'GraphQL' in integration options.
2. Click on 'GraphQL' and copy the query provided.
    
3. **Test the Query**
    
    You can either paste the query into your terminal or click 'Try it out' to test it in the GraphQL playground.

 4. **View Data in GraphQL Interface**

After testing, you can view the results in the GraphQL interface alongside the Studio tab.

You can now successfully integrate the query code into your application.

### **Using Postgres**

For those who prefer using the Postgres database, follow these steps:

1. **Copy Postgres Command**
    
    To interact with the Postgres database, copy the given PSQL client command and paste it into your terminal. When prompted for a password, enter your API key.
    
    ![postgres.png](/learn/dp_consumer_learn_track/explore_sm/postgres.png)
    
2. **Retrieve the API Key**
    
    To get the API key, click on the link in the password section of your connection details.
    
3. **Expected Output**
    
    Once you enter the command in the terminal, the following output confirms that the Postgres database connection was successful:
    
    ```bash
    psql (16.4 (Ubuntu 16.4-0ubuntu0.24.04.2), server 14.2 (Lens2/public:cross-sell-affinity v0.35.60-9))
    
    lens:public:cross-sell-affinity=>
    ```
    
    You can now interact with the Lens or semantic model using Postgres commands. For example, to list all tables in the connected database, use:
    
    ```yaml
    lens:public:cross-sell-affinity=> /dt
    ```
    
    **Expected Output:**
    
    ```yaml
                           List of relations
     Schema |             Name             | Type  |     Owner
    --------+------------------------------+-------+----------------
     public | cross_sell_opportunity_score | table | iamgroot
     public | customer                     | table | iamgroot
     public | product                      | table | iamgroot
     public | purchase_data                | table | iamgroot
     public | purchase_frequency           | table | iamgroot
     public | total_spending               | table | iamgroot
    
    ```
    
    ### **Additional PostgreSQL Commands**
    
    Here are some useful commands to interact with the Postgres database:
    
    | **Command** | **Description** | **Example** |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | `\d [table_name]` | Show the schema and details of a specific table. | `\d customers` |
    | `\l` | List all databases in the PostgreSQL server. | `\l` |
    | `\du` | List all roles and users in the PostgreSQL server. | `\du` |
    | `\dn` | List all schemas in the database. | `\dn` |
    | `\dv` | List all views in the connected database. | `\dv` |
    | `\q` | Exit the PostgreSQL prompt. | `\q` |
