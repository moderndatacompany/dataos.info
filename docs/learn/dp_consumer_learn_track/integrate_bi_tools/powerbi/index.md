# Power BI

In this guide, you will learn how to integrate a Data Product with Power BI and activate it to build rich, interactive dashboards.

### **Step 1: Navigate to the BI Sync Option**
    
To start the integration, go to the 'Access Options' tab and scroll to the 'Excel and PowerBI' option in the 'BI Sync' section. Click on the 'Download `.pbip` File' button to initiate the download of a ZIP folder.

### **Step 2: Extract the files**
    
After downloading the ZIP file, extract it to a directory on your local machine. Inside the extracted folder, you will find the essential files that help maintain semantic synchronization between the Data Product and Power BI.
    
The folder stores the main components of a Power BI project for syncing the Lens Model (here¬†`Product Affinity`), including folders like the`.Report`¬†and¬†`.SemanticModel`.

Following is a brief description of each:
    
- **public_productaffinity.Report:**¬†This folder holds contains¬†`definition.pbir`¬†file related to the report definition in Power BI. This file defines the visual representation of data, such as tables and charts, without storing actual data. It connects the semantic model and data sources to create the report views.
- **public-productaffinity.SemanticModel:**¬†This folder contains files that define the underlying data model for your Power BI project. The Semantic Model is crucial in managing how Power BI interacts with data and setting up relationships, hierarchies, and measures.
    - **definition.bism:**¬†This file represents the Business Intelligence Semantic Model (BISM). It defines the structure of your data, including data sources, relationships, tables, and measures for your Lens Model. The¬†`.bism`¬†file holds essential metadata that helps Power BI understand and query the data, forming the core of the data model for report creation and analysis.
    - **model.bim:**¬†Power BI uses the¬†`.bim`¬†file to generate queries and manage interactions with the dataset. When you build reports or dashboards in Power BI, it references this semantic model to ensure the correct structure is applied to the data.
- **public-productaffinity.pbip:**¬†This file is a Power BI project template or configuration file. Power BI uses files like¬†`.pbip`¬†or¬†`.pbix`¬†to encapsulate reports, datasets, and visualizations. The¬†`.pbip`¬†file ties together the semantic model and report definitions from the other folders, acting as the entry point for working on the project in Power BI Desktop or the Power BI service.

### **Step 3: Open the file in Power BI and connect**

Open the `public_productaffinity.pbip` file in Power BI. A popup will appear prompting you to enter your 'DataOS username' and 'API key'.

After entering your credentials, click 'Connect'. A confirmation popup will appear; click 'OK' to proceed.

### **Step 4: Access data tables and start building dashboards**

Once connected, you can see tables and views containing all dimensions and measures from the Data Product. You can now start building your dashboard by selecting the relevant fields for analysis.

## Supported data types

| **Category**   | **Data Types**                                                                  | **Support Status**                       |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Dimension**  | `time`, `string`, `number`, `boolean`                                                   | Supported                                |
| **Measure**    | `max`, `min`, `number`, `sum`, `count`, `boolean`, `string`, `time`, `avg`, `count_distinct`         | Supported                                |
| **Measure**    | `count_distinct_approx`                                                           | Not Supported                            |
| **Rolling Window** | -                                                                           | Not Supported (Power BI doesn‚Äôt support) |

## Important considerations

- In Power BI, measures typically have an 'm_' prefix to indicate they represent a measure. For example, a measure calculating total revenue might be named `m_total_revenue`.
- The connection is live, meaning any changes to the underlying data will be reflected in Power BI.
- If schema changes occur, such as the addition of new dimensions and measures, the steps outlined above will need to be repeated.
- Custom measures or dimensions created in Power BI may be lost during re-sync operations. It is recommended to implement custom logic directly within the Lens when possible to ensure persistence of customizations.

## Best practices

Adhering to best practices ensures that you effectively utilize the Data Product Hub and maintain compatibility with the latest features and updates. Following these guidelines will help optimize workflow, enhance performance, and prevent potential issues.

### **Version compatibility**

- Power BI versions released after June 15, 2023, support `.pbib` files. It is advisable to use a version released after this date.

- Beginning with Version 2.132.908.0 (August 2024), `.pbip` files have moved from preview to general availability. This transition allows for the use of `.pbip` files without the need to enable any preview settings. It is strongly recommended to download Power BI Version 2.132.908.0 or later to fully utilize `.pbip` files. 

<!-- 
In earlier versions, enabling a preview feature was necessary, but this is no longer required in the latest version. -->

### **File handling**

Ensure that `.pbip` folders are fully extracted before opening them. Failure to do so may result in missing file errors, as shown below:

</div>

### **Data retrieval and field selection considerations**

- **Row limit:** The Lens API has a maximum return limit of 50,000 rows per request. To obtain additional data, it is necessary to set an offset. This row limit is in place to manage resources efficiently and ensure optimal performance.

- **Selection:** It is important to select fields from tables that are directly related or logically joined, as the system does not automatically identify relationships between tables through transitive joins. Selecting fields from unrelated tables may result in incorrect or incomplete results.

### **Regular testing and validation**

Regular testing and validation of reports are recommended after changes are made to the Lens definitions. This practice ensures that updates to dimensions, measures, or data models are accurately reflected in the reports and helps identify any issues early in the process.

## Limitations

Power BI‚Äôs ‚ÄòDirect Query‚Äô mode does not support querying the rolling window measure. The lack of support for date hierarchy in 'Direct Query' prevents the application of granularity for the rolling window measure type.

## Governance of model on Power BI

Data masking, restrictions, and permissions established by the publisher are automatically enforced for all report viewers, ensuring consistent data security and compliance. The behavior of these data policies, such as masking, may vary based on the use of Power BI Desktop or other interfaces.

When the Lens semantic model is activated via BI Sync on Power BI, authentication and authorization are handled using the DataOS user ID and API key. This ensures that columns redacted by Lens data policies are restricted based on the user's group permissions.

For example, if a user named iamgroot, belonging to the 'Analyst' group, is restricted from viewing the 'Annual Salary' column, this column will not appear in either the Data Product exploration page or in Power BI after synchronization. Power BI requires the DataOS user ID and API key for authentication, ensuring that users can access the full model except for columns restricted by their data policies.

This approach ensures that users only see the data they are authorized to view, maintaining security and compliance.
