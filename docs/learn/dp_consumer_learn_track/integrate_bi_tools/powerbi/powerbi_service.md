## Prerequisites

<aside class="callout">
üó£Ô∏è <b>Important: Firewall and VPN Configuration Required</b>

  <ul>
    <li>If DataOS is installed in a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), port <code>6432</code> must be whitelisted to allow communication between the Power BI data gateway and the DataOS. Ensure that firewall rules permit inbound and outbound traffic on port <code>6432</code>.</li>
    <li>If the customer connects to the VPC via VPN, additional firewall rules may be required to allow communication between the VPN network and Power BI Service.</li>
  </ul>
</aside>

Before proceeding with the data gateway configuration, ensure the following components are installed:

- [Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/desktop) installed on the system(version released after June 15, 2023).

- A Power BI service account.

- [Npgsql](#installing-npgsql-for-postgresql-connectivity) (`v4.0.16` version or before).

- [On-premises data gateway](#installing-the-on-prem-data-gateway).

- Ensure that necessary ports (such as `6432`) and services are whitelisted.

## Create and publish a Power BI Desktop file

Follow the below steps to sync the integrate the `productaffinity` semantic model with the Power BI and create a basic Power BI report Publish the report to the Power BI service to get a Power BI semantic model.

### **Step 1: Navigate to the BI sync option**

In Data Product Hub, choose a Data Product let's say `product-affinity` Navigate to the Access Options tab on the Data Product Hub application on DataOS. Within a specific Data Product, and under the BI Sync options, select 'Excel and Power BI'. Click on the download icon to download the `.pbip` file.
    
<img src="/interfaces/data_product_hub/activation/bi_sync/powerbi/powerbi_service/pb_service_access_option_01.png" alt="DPH" style="width:40rem; height:auto; border: 1px solid black;" />

### **Step 2: Extract the files**

Once downloaded, locate the ZIP file in your file manager and extract it to your desired destination. The necessary files will then be available.

<img src="/interfaces/data_product_hub/activation/bi_sync/powerbi/powerbi_service/pb_serv_02.png" alt="DPH" style="width:40rem; height:auto; border: 1px solid black;" />
  
The folder stores the main components of a Power BI project for syncing the Lens Model (here Product Affinity), including folders like the.Report and .SemanticModel.

- **public_productaffinity.Report:** This folder contains `definition.pbir` file related to the report definition in Power BI. It stores the report metadata such as the version and dataset reference in JSON format.

- **public_productaffinity.SemanticModel:** This folder contains files that define the underlying data model for Power BI project. The semantic model plays a crucial role in managing how Power BI interacts with data, setting up relationships, and measures.

    - **definition.bism:** Contains the overall definition of a semantic model and core settings. This file also specifies the supported semantic model definition formats through the 'version' property.

    - **model.bim:** The model.bim file is a JSON file that contains the Tabular Model Scripting Language (TMSL) definition of a Power BI semantic model. It's used to create a database from scratch by defining objects such as measures, tables, and connection sources.

- **public_productaffinity.pbip:** The `.pbip` file contains a pointer to a report folder, opening a `.pbip` opens the targeted report and model.



### **Step 4: Open the file in Power BI and connect**

Open the `public_productaffinity` file in Power BI Desktop. A popup will appear prompting you to enter your 'DataOS username' and 'API key'.

<!-- ![image.png](attachment:e0514197-9d8c-4961-80a6-634f3a94a543:image.png) -->

After entering your credentials, click 'Connect'. A confirmation popup will appear; click 'OK' to proceed.

<!-- ![image.png](attachment:9512f7de-1358-4d44-938a-7416cea52ff2:image.png) -->

## Configuring a data gateway for PostgreSQL interface

In Power BI Desktop, you connected directly to your on-premises PostgreSQL interface. In the Power BI service, you need a data gateway to act as a bridge between the cloud and your on-premises network. Follow these steps to add your on-premises PostgreSQL interface as a data source to a gateway and connect your semantic model to this data source.

### **Add a Gateway connection**

To connect Power BI to the on-premises PostgreSQL interface via the data gateway, follow these steps:

1. In Power BI Service, navigate to the workspace where the semantic model has been published.

2. Locate the `productaffinity` semantic model in the content list.

5. A New Connection screen will appear, here ensure On-premises is selected and complete the following fields(some fields are pre-configured):
    
    <img src="/interfaces/data_product_hub/activation/bi_sync/powerbi/powerbi_service/config_gateway_05.png" 
        alt="DPH" 
        style="width:25rem; height:15%; border: 1px solid black;" />

        
6. Complete the following fields(some fields are pre-configured):

    - **Gateway Cluster Name**: Enter or verify the configured gateway name.
    - **Connection Name**: Provide a descriptive name (e.g., `productaffinity-testing`).
    - **Connection Type**: Ensure PostgreSQL interface is selected.
    - **Server**: Enter the PostgreSQL interface instance (e.g., `tcp.dataos-training-dataos.app:6432`).
    - **Database**: Specify the database name (e.g., `lens:public:productaffinity`).
    - **Authentication**: Select Basic authentication and enter the UserID and API Key (retrievable from the DataOS profile page).
    - **General encryption**: The encrypted connection should be set to 'Not encrypted'.

<aside class="callout">

## Supported data types

| **Category** | **Data Types** | **Support Status** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Dimension** | `time`,¬†`string`,¬†`number`,¬†`boolean` | Supported |
| **Measure** | `max`,¬†`min`,¬†`number`,¬†`sum`,¬†`count`,¬†`boolean`,¬†`string`,¬†`time`,¬†`avg`,¬†`count_distinct` | Supported |
| **Measure** | `count_distinct_approx` | Not Supported |
| **Rolling Window** | - | Not Supported (Power BI doesn‚Äôt support) |

## Important considerations

- In Power BI, measures typically have an 'm_' prefix to indicate they represent a measure. For example, a measure calculating total revenue might be named¬†`m_total_revenue`.
- The connection is live, meaning any changes to the underlying data will be reflected in Power BI.
- When schema changes occur, such as CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on dimensions, measures, or other elements of the semantic model, a re-sync is required. To prevent losing previously created reports after the re-sync, download the `.pbip` folder from the Data Product Hub, extract the contents, and replace the existing `.SemanticModel` folder with the new `.SemanticModel`.

## Best practices

Adhering to best practices ensures that you effectively utilize the Data Product Hub and maintain compatibility with the latest features and updates. Following these guidelines will help optimize workflow, enhance performance, and prevent potential issues.

### **File handling**

Ensure that¬†`.pbip`¬†folders are fully extracted before opening them. Failure to do so may result in missing file errors, as shown below:

<img src="/resources/lens/bi_integration/image.png" alt="DPH" style="width:15rem; border: 1px solid black;" />

### **Data retrieval and field selection considerations**

It is important to select fields from tables that are directly related or logically joined, as the system does not automatically identify relationships between tables through transitive joins. Selecting fields from unrelated tables may result in incorrect or incomplete results.

### **Connection reset**

If you encounter a 'connection reset' error during Power BI sync:

- Go to the Home tab in Power BI Desktop.
- Click the Refresh button in the Queries section.

<img src="/interfaces/data_product_hub/activation/bi_sync/powerbi/refresh_key.png" alt="DPH" style="width:25rem; border: 1px solid black;" />

This should resolve the error and restore the sync.

### **Unknown cluster**

Whenever you encounter the error `unknown cluster:<cluster_name>` as shown below, please check if the cluster has been deleted. If it has, redeploy the cluster. After redeploying the cluster, go to Power BI Desktop and click the 'Refresh' button to update the connection.

<img src="/interfaces/data_product_hub/activation/bi_sync/powerbi/cluster_error.png" alt="DPH" style="width:25rem; border: 1px solid black;" />

## Limitations

- Power BI fails to handle special characters (e.g., &, %, #) when generating queries through the synced semantic model, causing errors in visualizations. Thus, it is best practice to address or remove special characters directly in the data itself.
- Power BI's Direct Query mode does not support creating custom dimensions and measures or querying the rolling window measure due to the lack of date hierarchy.
- DAX functions and Import query mode are not supported.

## Governance of semantic model on Power BI Service

Data masking policies are enforced based on the user who creates and registers the gateway connection for the semantic model in PowerBI Service.
