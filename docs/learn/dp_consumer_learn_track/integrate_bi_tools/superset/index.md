5. **Access Data Product in Superset**
    
    After activation, go to the DataOS homepage. Scroll to the 'Apache Superset' section, click on 'Datasets', and locate your activated data product available as datasets. You’re now ready to start visualizing and building analytical dashboards.
    
6. **Creating Visualizations in Superset**
    
    To create a chart, select datasets labeled with the data product name. Choose the 'Measures' and 'Dimensions' that best suit your analysis goals. This enables you to explore and analyze data directly from the 'Product 360' model within Superset, making it easy to generate insights.
