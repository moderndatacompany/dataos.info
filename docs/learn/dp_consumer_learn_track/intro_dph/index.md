## What is a Metric?

A Metric is an entity that, by default, provides a logical view of a logical table, containing only one measure and a time dimension. This means that a Metric represents a specific data point or calculation over time, focusing on one key measure, such as average spent per category, retention rate, or churn rate, and linking it to a time for analysis. 

On Data Product Hub, you can access and analyze key business metrics in one place for a unified view of organizational performance and decision-making. Further details of the Metrics are provided in the later modules.

## What is a Perspective?

A Perspective is a saved exploration of a Data Product. A Perspective can be created for any Data Product that has an exposed semantic model. After exploring the Data Product on the Data Product Hub, the exploration can be saved as a Perspective, which can then be accessed in the Perspective tab.
