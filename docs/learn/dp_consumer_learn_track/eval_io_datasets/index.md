# Evaluating input & output datasets 

This topic explains how to access detailed information about input and output datasets. Users can explore these details through two options available in the Data Product Hub: delve into Metis to review metadata, schema, and quality standards, or explore them directly in Workbench for a greater insight into the data.

## Scenario

To gain a deeper understanding of the data you plan to use for the marketing campaign, you thoroughly explore the input and output datasets of the 'Product 360' Data Product. You analyze the schema and metadata for insights, such as identifying missing fields or outdated entries, to better comprehend the data.

On Data Product Hub, open the data product details and follow the below steps:

## Step 1: Start with Data Product details

Begin by reviewing the data product's input and output datasets in the Data Product Hub. This initial overview provides insight into the datasetâ€™s structure and integrity. For deeper details, open the dataset in Metis to explore schema, quality, lineage, and policies.

## Step 2: Explore metadata of input dataset in Metis

For structured data sources, you will see comprehensive details such as asset type, meta version, last update time, follower count, and various editing options for owner, tier, domain, tags, and description.

You will see the DataOS address for your dataset. Within DataOS, each source system is identified by a unique Uniform Data Link (UDL). This address acts as a consistent reference point, regardless of the source system's internal naming conventions and structure. Leveraging the UDL enables access to datasets and seamless execution of various operations.

You will also get schema details, including table/column names, their descriptions and type, constraints, and sensitive tags, etc. You can suggest some tags if required.

### **4. Check Data Quality**

The information includes data validation rules for the customer dataset, organized by type (table-level or column-level) and focus area (Schema, Accuracy, Completeness, Validity). Each rule is paired with recent run statuses ('Last 5 Runs') to monitor ongoing compliance.

This information is critical to assess the datasetâ€™s integrity. Monitoring these checks allows quick identification and correction of data issues, improving reliability for downstream processes.

![dataset_quality.png](/learn/dp_consumer_learn_track/eval_io_datasets/dataset_quality.png)

Based on the provided rules and their descriptions, potential quality issues and the probable action are listed :

| Issue | Rule | Description | Action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Data Type Mismatch** | Birth year should be integer | Non-integer values in `birth_year` may cause processing errors. | Convert to integers and enforce integer format validation during entry. |
| **Country Field Accuracy** | Avg. length of country > 6 | Short entries in `country` may indicate incomplete or incorrect names. | Standardize to full names and apply cleaning to correct abbreviations or incomplete data. |
| **Customer ID Completeness** | Customer ID should not be zero | Zero values in `customer_id` may imply missing or placeholder IDs, affecting uniqueness. | Replace zero values with unique IDs; review processes to prevent zero entries. |

### **5. Investigate Data Lineage**

View the lineage of the dataset to understand its source, transformations, and dependencies. By checking lineage, you can see the jobs that created and modified the dataset, helping you confirm that the data is prepared and processed to meet your use case requirements.

## Best practices

- **Assess metadata thoroughly**: Check for accurate descriptions of datasets and columns.

- **Evaluate data profiling metrics**: Inspect column profiles for null values, unique counts, and patterns. Use this to detect outliers or anomalies early.

- **Investigate lineage and dependencies**: Understand data transformations and sources. This information will help you understand whether the dataset meets the use-case requirements.

- **Check governance policies**: Know about compliance with regulatory and security standards, especially for sensitive data fields. You can 

## Guidelines: Do's and Don'ts

**Do's**

- Ask for missing column descriptions, as they provide essential context and help you fully understand the data.

- Use the 'Last 5 Runs' feature to track data quality trends over time and identify recurring issues.


**Don'ts**

- Don't rely on datasets with unresolved quality issues or failed validation checks, as these can propagate errors into downstream processes.

- Don't overlook untagged or misclassified columns, as they can create governance and compliance gaps.
    For instance, the email and phone columns in the following dataset lack tags to identify them as sensitive data, you can request the addition of appropriate tags to ensure their protection.
