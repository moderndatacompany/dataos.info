# Data quality checks with Soda Stack

Maintaining high data quality is crucial for delivering reliable insights and making informed business decisions. As a Data Product developer, you often encounter issues like missing values, incorrect data formats, or unexpected data inconsistencies. Identifying and resolving these problems proactively is essential to ensure the accuracy and trustworthiness of your data products.

Use Soda Stack within DataOS to establish robust data quality checks. With Soda Checks Language (SodaCL), you can seamlessly define validation rules in your workflow to monitor critical metrics like accuracy, completeness, and uniqueness.

For example, you can automate checks to ensure customer data integrity by verifying the absence of missing customer numbers and detecting duplicate phone records. This streamlined approach proactively identifies data issues, preserving the reliability and trustworthiness of your data product.
