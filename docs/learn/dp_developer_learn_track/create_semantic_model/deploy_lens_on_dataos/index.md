# Deploy Lens in DataOS 

In this topic, you'll learn how to deploy your semantic model(Lens) in DataOS. This step ensures your model is accessible, reliable, and ready for real-time use, enabling stakeholders to derive insights and make data-driven decisions.

## Scenario

After thorough testing of your Lens model in a local environment, the next critical step is to deploy it to a production setting within DataOS. This process ensures that your model is accessible and reliable for broader usage, enabling stakeholders to leverage it for real-time data insights and decision-making.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into configuring Lens, make sure you have everything ready:

1. **Check required Permissions**: Some tasks require specific permissions typically assigned to DataOS Operators. Ensure you have access to one of the following permission sets either via use-cases or via tags:

    | **Access Permission (via use-cases)**       | **Access Permissions (via tags)**      |
    |--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
    | Read Workspace                             | `roles:id:data-dev `                  |
    |Create Update and Delete Lens in user layer specified workspace| `roles:id:system-dev`  |
    | Read all secrets from Heimdall             |  `roles:id:operator`                                    |

2. **Check CLI installation and initialization**: You need this text-based interface that allows you to interact with the DataOS context via command prompts. Click [here](/interfaces/cli/) to learn more.

3. **Manage Credentials Securely**: Use **Instance Secrets** for storing your data source credentials, ensuring sensitive information remains protected.

    > **Important**: To prevent credential exposure, contact DataOS administrator and understand the best practices for handling sensitive data.

4. **Organize Your Code Repository**: Place Lens manifests in a private, permission-controlled repository to maintain security and compliance. 

## Steps

You follow the below steps to deploy a Lens on DataOS.


### **Step 1: Push the Lens model directory to a code repository**

You first push your Lens model directory to a hosted code repository such as¬†[Bitbucket](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/push-code-to-bitbucket/),¬†[GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/migrations/importing-source-code/using-the-command-line-to-import-source-code/adding-locally-hosted-code-to-github),¬†[AWS CodeCommit](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecommit/latest/userguide/getting-started.html),¬†etc.

<aside class="callout">
üó£Ô∏è If your code repository is private, you must create¬†Instance Secrets¬†with your repository credentials for later use during deployment. Public code repositories do not require Step 2. However, we recommend keeping your repository private to secure your API Keys.

</aside>

### **Step 2: Create Instance Secrets for code repository credentials**

Create and configure an Instance Secret to secure your code repository credentials. This involves the following steps:

**Create an Instance Secret manifest file**

Define the Instance Secret Resource in a YAML file. Below is a template you can use for Bitbucket, substituting¬†`${USERNAME}`¬†and¬†`${PASSWORD}`¬†with your actual Bitbucket credentials:

```yaml
# RESOURCE META SECTION
name: bitbucket-r # Secret Resource name (mandatory)
version: v1 # Secret manifest version (mandatory)
type: instance-secret # Type of Resource (mandatory)
description: Bitbucket read secrets for code repository # Secret Resource description (optional)
layer: user # DataOS Layer (optional)

# INSTANCE SECRET-SPECIFIC SECTION
instance-secret: 
  type: key-value # Type of Instance-secret (mandatory)
  acl: r # Access control list (mandatory)
  data: # Data (mandatory)
    GITSYNC_USERNAME: iamgroot
    GITSYNC_PASSWORD: <git_token>
```

**Apply the Instance Secret manifest**

Deploy the Instance Secret to DataOS using the¬†`apply`¬†command.

<aside class="callout">
üó£Ô∏è When applying the manifest file for Instance-secret from CLI, ensure you don't specify Workspace as Instance Secret is a¬†[Instance-level Resource](/resources/types/#instance-level-resources).

</aside>

You¬†apply the manifest file as follows:

```bash
dataos-ctl apply -f ./lens/instance_secret.yml
# Expected output
INFO[0000] üõ† apply...                                   
INFO[0000] üîß applying bitbucket-r:v1:instance-secret... 
INFO[0001] üîß applying bitbucket-r:v1:instance-secret...created 
INFO[0001] üõ† apply...complete
```

<aside class="callout">
üó£Ô∏è Make a note of the name of the created `Instance Secret`, as it will be required in the secrets attribute section of the Lens manifest file. This name is essential for ensuring proper configuration and access within your Lens environment.
</aside>

### **Step 3: Create a Lens Resource manifest file**

You  begin by creating a manifest file that holds the configuration details for your Lens Resource. The structure of the Lens manifest file is provided below.

The manifest file of a Lens can be broken down into two sections:

1. Resource meta section
2. Lens-specific section

<aside class="callout">
üó£Ô∏è In DataOS, a Lens is categorized as a Resource type. The YAML configuration file for a Lens Resource includes a Resource meta section, which contains attributes shared among all Resource types.
</aside>

The following YAML excerpt illustrates the attributes specified within this section:

To configure a lens Resource, replace `name`,¬†`layer`,¬†`tags`,¬†`description`, and¬†`owner`¬†values with appropriate values. For additional configuration information about the attributes of the Resource meta section, refer to the link:¬†[Attributes of Resource meta section](/resources/manifest_attributes/).

A typical deployment of a Lens Resource includes the following components:

| **Section** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Source** | Defines the configuration of the data source for data processing and querying. |
| **Repo** | Outlines the configuration of the code repository where the model used by Lens resides. |
| **API** | Configures an API service that processes incoming requests, connecting to the database for raw data. A single instance is provisioned by default, but the system can auto-scale to add more instances based on workload demands, with a recommendation of one instance for every 5-10 requests per second. |
| **Worker** | When¬†`LENS2_REFRESH_WORKER`¬†is set to true, a Refresh Worker manages and refreshes the memory cache in the background, keeping refresh keys for all data models up-to-date. It invalidates the in-memory cache but does not populate it, which is done lazily during query execution. |
| **Router** | Configures a Router Service responsible for receiving queries from Lens, managing metadata, and handling query planning and distribution to the workers. Lens communicates only with the Router, not directly with the workers. |
| **Iris** | Manages interaction with Iris dashboards. |
| **Metrics** | Populates the metrics in the metric section of the Data Product Hub. |

### **Step 4: Apply the Lens Resource manifest file**

Apply the Lens manifest file using the `apply` command as shownn below, or reference the Lens manifest path in the Bundle Resource along with other Resources.

```shell
dataos-ctl apply -f /home/data_product/resources/lens/deployment.yaml #path
```
