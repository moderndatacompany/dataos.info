# Understanding business goals

This guide provides a structured approach to identify the **North Star Metric** for your business and develop a data product by working backward from business goals to source data. Each step builds on the previous one, ensuring a clear alignment between business objectives and technical execution.

## Step 1: Define the vision and goals

**Vision  is a**  single, concise statement representing the high-level value the data product aims to deliver.

- Define the vision and with stakeholders ensure alignment and agreement.

**Goals is s**pecific targets that deliver on the vision, with measurable success indicators.

- Conduct a collaborative session to define clear, quantifiable goals and associated measures.

## Step 2: Define hypotheses and initiatives

Hypotheses is a statements linking initiatives to goals such as  “We believe that `<initiative>` will help achieve `<goal>`.”

- Brainstorm and finalize the most promising hypotheses with stakeholders.

**Initiatives are a**pproaches to realize the goals. Multiple initiatives might support one goal.

- Define and evaluate different initiatives to determine feasibility and relevance.

## Step 3: Prioritize use cases and Data Products

**Use Cases are p**ractical applications of the chosen hypothesis.

- Identify and prioritize use cases based on business needs.
- Map each use case to relevant data products.

Data Products are components interacting to fulfill use cases.

- Identify data producers (sources) and consumers (stakeholders, systems).
- Define dependencies across domains if applicable.

## Closing the Loop: North Star Metric Identification

1. Start with the North Star Metric:
    - Define what success looks like for your business in terms of measurable outcomes.
    - Document target metrics and map them to goals to guide development.
    - Align all goals and initiatives to this metric.
2. Work backward:
    - Identify the measures, dimensions, and data sources required to track progress.
    - Ensure every step ties back to achieving the North Star Metric.
3. Build with purpose:
    - Use the right-to-left approach to design a data product that directly serves the defined goals.

## Next step

Let us understand the above steps in action with the example of the *‘Product Affinity’ Data Product. We will design this Data Product* to analyze customer purchasing patterns to identify product affinities and opportunities for cross-selling. This Data Product is aimed to help marketing and sales teams create targeted campaigns, enhance customer experience, and increase revenue through strategic product recommendations.
