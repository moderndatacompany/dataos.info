# Data Product Developer Track

!!! info "Overview"
    With a strong emphasis on aligning technical execution with business objectives, this track ensures learners can confidently translate requirements into reliable, governed data products that drive value across the organization.

**Data Product Developers** play a key role in creating, managing, and evolving Data Products within DataOS. They are responsible for building the data infrastructure that powers everything from analytics to business intelligence, making sure data flows smoothly through pipelines and stays accurate and accessible for users.

## What you‚Äôll learn

As a Data Products Developer, you'll master how to:

- **Connect and Ingest Data Securely**: Integrate APIs, SaaS, databases, and file systems using Secrets and Depots, and ingest data with governed workflows.

- **Design and Build Governed Architecture**: Architect layered storage (raw, curated, semantic) while ensuring lineage, access control, and compliance.

- **Develop and Automate Scalable Pipelines**: Build robust pipelines using Flare, or Bento with scheduling, triggers, and error handling.

- **Ensure Data Quality and Trust**: Apply validation, profiling, masking, and audit controls to maintain clean, compliant, and reliable data.

- **Enable Consumption Through APIs and Models**: Publish semantic models and APIs via Lens, Talos, and other tools to serve analysts, apps, and business users.
