# Ontology

In a way, with DataOS, you create an electronic/digital rendering of your entire data network. Ontology can help you create a coherent navigation across all your data assets; and connect real-world business decisions to the underlying data & models. You can further use these capabilities to solve custom use-cases, train datasets and discover hidden value chains.

We believe in Intelligent Data Movement - where you only move data when you know what outcomes can be derived from it. Ontology shifts the power of data into the hands of the business users, further solidifying our right-to-left approach.  

## Metis

With Metis, we have taken a step-forward from traditional Data Catalogs you see in Big Data world. Being a Data Catalog, it incorporates the features of a centralized metadata repository, while concurrently providing additional functionalities. To learn more, refer to
[Metis](Ontology/Metis.md).

## Lens

A semantic layer that is capable of accessing & modeling data from disparate sources. It allows you to define a data contract that expresses a business concept via entities, measures & dimensions. 

Using Lens, business users can completely decouple themselves from the needs of data engineering and simply declare what data models, measures, and metrics they need. To create & use Lenses, refer to
[Lens](Ontology/Lens.md).

In simple words, knowledge graphs serve as a hub for data and its metadata and offer a unified, consistent, and unambiguous view of data scattered across different systems. Data is represented in a uniform, human-friendly and meaningful way.

Knowledge graph built with semantic metadata gives your data business context. They serve as a contract between the developers of the knowledge graph and its users regarding the meaning of the data in it.
