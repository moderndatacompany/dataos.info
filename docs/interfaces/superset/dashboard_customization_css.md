## Margin and Padding

Margin in Superset refers to the external space around the chart or dashboard container. It defines the clearance outside the element, providing separation from adjacent elements or the container's boundaries.

Padding in Superset refers to the internal space within the chart or dashboard container. It defines the clearance between the content (charts, text, etc.) and the container's borders.

Modify the margin and padding effortlessly with the provided CSS code:

```css
.chart-container {
  margin: 10px;
  padding: 5px;
}
```

### **Font weight**

Tailor the font weight to your preference using the following CSS command:

```css
.header-title {
  font-size: 18px;
  font-weight: bold;
}
```

### **Position**

Adjust the position of the chart's title effortlessly using the following CSS command:

```css
.header-title {
position: absolute;
top: 320px;
left: 40%;
transform: translateX(-50%);
}
```

**`position: absolute`**

When an element is positioned absolutely, it is removed from the normal flow of the document, and its position is calculated based on the nearest positioned ancestor (or the document itself if there is no positioned ancestor).

**`top: 320px`**

Sets the distance from the top of the containing element.

**`left:40%`**

Positions the left edge of the title at 40% of the containing element's width.

**`transform: translatex(-50%)`**

Used to horizontally center the title, adjusting it by 50% of its width.

## Hiding the Title

Hide chart titles at your discretion using the provided CSS code:

```css
.header-title {
    display: none !important;
}
```

ðŸ—£ In Superset, <code>!important</code> can be used in custom CSS rules to ensure they take precedence over existing styles. While <code>!important</code> can be effective for overriding styles, it should be used sparingly to maintain code readability and avoid potential conflicts.
