The following type of resources can be monitored:

- **User Kernel** - These are the resources that DataOS users can create and manage within the platform. This includes various primitives such as workflows, services, secrets, depots, clusters, and computes. These resources are utilized during data processing jobs, services, and analytics workloads performed by users. Operations UI provides a way for users to observe and monitor these resources and their runtimes to debug if any issues.

- **Core Kernel** - The Core Kernel consists of system resources that are essential for the smooth operation of the DataOS platform. It provides low-level services and functionalities used by the core components of DataOS to ensure its proper functioning. Monitoring the Core Kernel resources and accessing their logs helps track the health and performance of these critical components, ensuring the overall stability and reliability of the DataOS platform.

- **Cloud Kernel** - The Cloud Kernel encompasses resources specifically designed for running and managing workloads in a cloud environment. These resources include virtual machines (VMs), container services, and other cloud-based infrastructure components. Monitoring the health and usage of the Cloud Kernel resources allows users to optimize their cloud-based workloads, ensure efficient resource utilization, and maintain the availability and performance of their applications and services.

- **Product** - In this section, you can find information about the release name and version of the DataOS platform and its associated components. This helps users keep track of the software versions they are working with and stay updated on the latest releases and features offered by DataOS.

## User Kernel 
### **Resources and their runtime**

By navigating to the "Resources" tab, the detailed information about the DataOS primitives created  by users can be accessed such as workflows, services, secrets, depots, clusters, compute, etc. This includes insights into the current running status of these resources, as well as the owner or creator of each resource. The "Resources" tab provides a centralized view of the user-created components, allowing users to monitor and manage their resources effectively.

</center>
<figcaption align = "center">Runtime information </figcaption>

**Resource YAML**

It serves as a configuration file that defines the desired state of the resource within the DataOS environment. By examining the Resource YAML, users can gain insights into the specific configurations and settings applied to each resource. It includes the resource type, metadata, and specific properties associated with each resource. The Resource YAML is created by the user and resource is typically created using the DataOS CLI command **`apply`**. 

All these YAMLs also have the auto-generated section â€˜statusâ€™ that conveys information about the build state, runtime state, and the required cloud kernel resources and web resources.
 

**Runtime Node Details**

Under Runtime Nodes, click on a node to get the runtime YAML, Logs, and Runtime Node Usage. Here you will get the container details, their state, and pod lifecycle conditions(Ready, PodScheduledâ€¦) with a status (True, False or Unknown) that make up the â€˜computed stateâ€™ of a pod at any time.

## Core Kernel- Resources

Here you will get the resource details responsible for running the core components. These resources are isolated in groups as namespaces within a single cluster. These namespaces help different projects, teams, or customers to share a Kubernetes cluster. Names of resources need to be unique within a namespace but not across namespaces. Namespace-based scoping is applicable only for name-spaced objectsÂ *(e.g. Deployments, Services, workloads, etc).* 

### **Pods**

When DataOS components are deployed in Kubernetes, that Deployment creates Pods with containers inside them  Each Pod is tied to the Node where it is scheduled and remains there until termination or deletion. In case of a Node failure, identical Pods are scheduled on other available Nodes in the cluster.

*DataOS components are deployed in separate namespaces.* After selecting the namespace, you can see components deployed in that namespace. Here you will get the pod details for the  DataOS components for the selected namespace and the phase. 

![Picture](operations/core_kernel1.png)
<figcaption align = "center"> Core kernel pods</figcaption>

The phase of a Pod is a simple, high-level summary of where the Pod is in its lifecycle.

Here are the possible values forÂ `phase`.

| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Pending | The Pod has been accepted by the Kubernetes cluster, but one or more of the containers has not been set up and made ready to run. This includes the time a Pod spends waiting to be scheduled as well as the time spent downloading container images over the network. |
| Running | The Pod has been bound to a node, and all of the containers have been created. At least one container is still running or is in the process of starting or restarting. |
| Succeeded | All containers in the Pod have terminated in success, and will not be restarted. |
| Failed | All containers in the Pod have terminated, and at least one container has terminated in failure. That is, the container either exited with non-zero status or was terminated by the system. |
| Unknown | For some reason, the state of the Pod could not be obtained. This phase typically occurs due to an error in communicating with the node where the Pod should be running. |
 

Clicking on a particular pod will give you pod details, Pod YAML, Pod logs, and Pod usage.

**Pod Details**

This gives you pod and container details and container status. You will also get pod lifecycle conditions(Ready, PodScheduledâ€¦). A Pod has a PodStatus, which has an array ofÂ PodConditionsÂ through which the Pod has or has not passed:

- `PodScheduled`: the Pod has been scheduled to a node.
- `ContainersReady`: all containers in the Pod are ready.
- `Initialized`: allÂ init containersÂ have completed successfully.
- `Ready`: the Pod is able to serve requests.

The pod lifecycle conditions are with a status (True, False, or Unknown) that makes up a pod's â€˜computed stateâ€™ at any time. You can track the state of each container inside a Pod.

**Pod YAML**

This is Kubernetes generated YAML for this resource where you can see the metadata information such as API version, resource version, its unique id, labels, deployment type, etc. You will also find the â€˜specâ€™ property, which includes containers(image, ports, env, etc), memory requirements, storage volumes, tolerations and runtime status, etc.

**Pod Logs**

This option will enable you to access live stream logs produced by a named Pod to your terminal, letting you inspect the output from your application and diagnose a problem with your clusterâ€™s workloads.

**Pod Usage**

This gives you the aggregate of the CPU use of all containers for the selected pod. Likewise, pod memory utilization refers to the total aggregate of memory used by all containers in the pod.

### **Services**

DataOS services are a means to interact with the Kubernetes system for running the core functionality/components. Select a namespace to get the list of services with their fully qualified domain name. All these services are deployed in the separate logical grouping called namespaces.

**Service Details**

Click on the service from the selected namespace to view the port details, service and pod endpoints, etc.

### **Workloads**

A workload is a DataOS application running in one or more Kubernetes pods. You have the following workload types.

- **Deployments** are useful for stateless applications. Deployments create and manage identical pods called replicas, based on a pod template. If a pod stops or becomes unresponsive, the deployment's controller will replace it.

- **Stateful sets** live up to their name, they're useful for stateful applications, that's things such as a database. Stateful sets create and manage pods that are expected to have a level of persistence. They allow for stable network identifiers and persistent storage.

- **Daemon sets** are useful for background tasks such as monitoring by creating one pod per node.

## Cloud Kernel 
### **Resources**

Within a cloud environment, compute nodes form a core of resources. They supply the processing, memory, network, and storage that virtual machine instances need. When an instance is created, it is matched to a compute node with the available resources. Here you will access the details about these compute nodes, their creation time, and cloud service provider.

### **Compute Node Details**

Click on the compute node to see all the details about the general information, such as the operating system used by the node, OS image, Kubernetes version, architecture, etc., and compute node status, which includes:

- **Addresses**- host IP and hostname. This information varies depending on the cloud provider.
- **Conditions**- status of all running computing nodes.
- **Capacity and allocatable**- resources available on the node: CPU, memory, and the maximum number of pods that can be scheduled onto the node.
- **Taints**- automatically created by the Kubernetes control plane when problems occur on nodes,  that match the conditions affecting the node.
