# CLI Installation

Follow the steps enumerated below to install the Command Line Interface. Check the prerequisites before moving forward.

## Requirements

 1. Get the following items from our **Customer Success** team:
    - DataOS prime apikey
    - Domain name of the DataOS context/instance
    - Version of the CLI to be installed
 2. Please ensure that the curl utility is installed on your system. To check, use this command:
    ```sh
    curl --version
    ```
    If curl is not installed, follow the steps to [download curl](/interfaces/cli/read_on_curl_utility/).

 3. Find out the operating system you are using, and the processor's architecture. The following is a list of supported Arch values:
     

     | Operating System | Processor | Arch |
     | --- | --- | --- |
     | `MacOS` | Intel | darwin-amd64 (works for both intel & amd chips)
     |  | AMD | darwin-amd64 |
     |  | M1 & M2| darwin-arm64 |
     | `Linux` | Intel | linux-386 |
     |  | AMD  | linux-amd64 |
     |  | M1 & M2 (64 bit) | linux-arm64 |
     | `Windows` | 32bit | 386|
     | | 64bit | amd64 (works for both intel & amd chips)|
  
   <aside class="callout">üó£Ô∏è Replace <b>{{placeholder}}</b> text in various commands with appropriate values before running the command.</aside>

## Installation on MacOS

1. Export the environment variable PRIME_APIKEY to pass it to the subsequent commands(replace **`prime_apikey`**  with the DataOS¬Æ API key to connect with the prime context).

    ```sh
    export PRIME_APIKEY="{{prime_apikey}}"

    ```

2. Determine processor architecture with the following command.
    ```
    uname -m
    ```
    Sample output:

    ```
    x86_64
    ```
    You can use this output with the "darwin" prefix as ARCH value in your shell commands to specify the architecture. The available values are `darwin-amd64`, `darwin-arm64` for different types of processors on macOS.

    <aside class="callout">üó£Ô∏è Contact the admin (DataOS operator in your organization) to get the correct and latest version of the CLI.</aside>

3. Download the DataOS CLI binary using the below command (replace the **`ARCH`** </span> value of the processor and the **`CLI_VERSION`** </span>to be installed):

    ```shell
    curl --silent --output dataos-ctl-{{ARCH}}.tar.gz --location --request GET "https://prime.tmdata.io/plutus/api/v1/files/download?name=dataos-ctl-{{ARCH}}.tar.gz&dir=cli-apps-{{CLI_VERSION}}&apikey=$PRIME_APIKEY"
    ```
    
    Example:

    A Mac user with intel-chip, installing the 2.8 version of the CLI would input the below command.
    
    ```shell
    curl --silent --output dataos-ctl-darwin-amd64.tar.gz --location --request GET "https://prime.tmdata.io/plutus/api/v1/files/download?name=dataos-ctl-darwin-amd64.tar.gz&dir=cli-apps-2.8&apikey=$PRIME_APIKEY"
    ```

4. *Optional step*: Download the checksum file using the following command (replace the **`ARCH`** value of the processor and the **`CLI_VERSION`** to be installed):

    ```shell
    curl --silent --output dataos-ctl-{{ARCH}}.tar.gz.sha256sum --location --request GET "https://prime.tmdata.io/plutus/api/v1/files/download?name=dataos-ctl-{{ARCH}}.tar.gz.sha256sum&dir=cli-apps-{{CLI_VERSION}}&apikey=$PRIME_APIKEY"
    ```

    Example:

    A Mac user with an intel-chip (identified as  **darwin-amd64** for the processor), installing the **2.8 version of the CLI** would input the below command.

    ```shell
    
    curl --silent --output dataos-ctl-darwin-amd64.tar.gz.sha256sum --location --request GET "https://prime.tmdata.io/plutus/api/v1/files/download?name=dataos-ctl-darwin-amd64.tar.gz.sha256sum&dir=cli-apps-2.8&apikey=$PRIME_APIKEY"
    ```
    

5. *Optional step*: Validate that the zip has not been tampered with.

    ```shell
    shasum -a 256 -c dataos-ctl-{{Arch}}.tar.gz.sha256sum
    ```
    Example:

    ```shell
    shasum -a 256 -c dataos-ctl-darwin-amd64.tar.gz.sha256sum
    ```

    If the zip file has been downloaded as expected, you should get the following output:

    ```shell
    dataos-ctl-darwin-amd64.tar.gz: OK
    ```

6. Extract the dataos-ctl binary.

    ```shell
    tar -xvf dataos-ctl-{{ARCH}}.tar.gz
    ```
    Example:

    ```shell
    tar -xvf dataos-ctl-darwin-amd64.tar.gz
    ```
    Here is the expected output:

    ```shell
    x darwin-amd64/
    x darwin-amd64/dataos-ctl
    ```

7. Run the following command to place the extracted dataos-ctl in a directory that is in your PATH. 

    ```shell
    export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/{{dir-name}}
    ```
    You will get the directory name from the output of the previous command. 
    Example:

    In this case, it is **`darwin-amd64/`**.
    ```
    export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/darwin-amd64/
    ```
    <br>

    > üó£Ô∏è  To access DataOS, you have to run this command every time you restart your computer‚Äôs terminal or open a new tab in the terminal. To avoid this, you should add the above path to your .zshrc file.
    > 
    > - To add the path to your .zshrc file, you can follow the steps given in this toggle list. Click the toggle icon.
    >     
    >     ```bash
    >     # make sure you are in your home directory "~/ (home/<user>)"
    >     # create a .zshrc file using the command below

    >     touch .zshrc
    >     
    >     # open the file using the command below

    >     ~/.zshrc
    >     
    >     # Copy & paste the path to your .zshrc file

    >     export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.dataos/bin
    >     
    >     # close the .zshrc file window and load the file in the shell using

    >     source ~/.zshrc
    >     ```
    >     

You have successfully installed the CLI, now the next step is to [initialize](#initialize) the DataOS context.

## Installation on Linux

1. Export the environment variable PRIME_APIKEY to pass it to the subsequent commands.

    ```bash
    export PRIME_APIKEY={{DataOS¬Æ prime apikey}}
    ```

2. Determine processor architecture.

    ```bash
    uname -p
    ```

    You will get the following output based on your processor. 

    ```bash
    amd64 
    ```
    
    if the output here appears as x86_64, it also means you have amd64 processor. The available ARCH values are linux-386, linux-amd64, linux-arm, linux-arm64.

    <aside class="callout">üó£Ô∏è Contact the admin (DataOS operator in your organization) to get the correct and latest version of the CLI.</aside>
    

3. Download the CLI binary file using the following command (replace the **`ARCH`** & **`CLI_version`** before executing the command).

    ```bash
    curl --silent --output dataos-ctl-linux-{{ARCH}}.tar.gz --location --request GET "https://prime.tmdata.io/plutus/api/v1/files/download?name=dataos-ctl-linux-{{ARCH}}.tar.gz&dir=cli-apps-{{CLI_version}}&apikey=$PRIME_APIKEY"
    
    ```

4. *Optional step*: Update the **`ARCH`** value & **`CLI_version`** in the following command to download the checksum file. 

    ```bash
    curl --silent --output dataos-ctl-linux-{{ARCH}}.tar.gz.sha256sum --location --request GET "https://prime.tmdata.io/plutus/api/v1/files/download?name=dataos-ctl-linux-{{ARCH}}.tar.gz.sha256sum&dir=cli-apps-{{CLI_VERSION}}&apikey=$PRIME_APIKEY"
    ```
    Example: 
    
    For CLI version 2.5 getting installed, the command would be:
    ```bash
    curl --silent --output dataos-ctl-linux-amd64.tar.gz.sha256sum --location --request GET "https://prime.tmdata.io/plutus/api/v1/files/download?name=dataos-ctl-linux-amd64.tar.gz.sha256sum&dir=cli-apps-2.5&apikey=$PRIME_APIKEY"
    ```


5. *Optional step*: Validate that the zip has not been tampered with. Update the **`ARCH`** value in the command.


    ```shell
    
    shasum -a 256 -c dataos-ctl-linux-{{ARCH}}.tar.gz.sha256sum
    ```

    Expected output after running the above command:

    ```bash
    dataos-ctl-linux-{{ARCH}}.tar.gz: OK
    ```

6. Extract the dataos-ctl binary. Update the **`ARCH`** value in the command


    ```shell
    
    tar -xvf dataos-ctl-linux-{{ARCH}}.tar.gz
    ```

    Expected output:

    ```bash
    x linux-{{ARCH}}/
    x linux-{{ARCH}}/dataos-ctl
    ```

7. Run the following command to place the extracted dataos-ctl in a directory that is in your PATH.

    ```shell
    export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/linux-{{ARCH}}
    ```
    
    Example:
    
    ```
    export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/linux-amd64
    ```

    > üó£Ô∏è  To access DataOS, you have to run this command every time you restart your computer‚Äôs terminal or open a new tab in the terminal. To avoid this, you should add the above path to your .bashrc file.

    >     
    >     # save and close the .bashrc file window and load the file in the shell using the command

    >     source ~/.bashrc
    >     ```
    >     

You have successfully installed the CLI, now the next step is to [initialize](/interfaces/cli/initialization/) the DataOS context. 

## Installation on Windows

1. Check whether your system has an Intel 64 bit chip or an AMD chip. To find out the architecture, use the following command.
   ```
   wmic cpu get architecture
   ```
   Sample Output:
   ```
   Architecture
   9 # Required Value
   ```
    - If the required value is **0** or **x86,** then it's a 32-bit architecture; in that case, use the **`ARCH`** value as **386**.
    - If the required value is **6, 9,** or **x64**, then it's a 64-bit architecture; in that case, use the **`ARCH`** value as **amd64**.
   
    <aside class="callout">üó£Ô∏è Contact the admin (DataOS operator in your organization) to get the correct and latest version of the CLI.</aside>

2. Download the DataOS CLI .tar file using the following link in the browser (replace the **`ARCH`**, **`CLI_VERSION`**, and **`PRIME_APIKEY`** with respective values).
    ```
    https://prime.tmdata.io/plutus/api/v1/files/download?name=dataos-ctl-windows-{{ARCH}}.tar.gz&dir=cli-apps-{{CLI_VERSION}}&apikey={{PRIME_APIKEY}}
    ```
    
    Example:
    To install CLI version 2.8 for a windows machine with amd64 processor and Prime Apikey as abcdefgh12345678987654321, run the following command.

    ```
    https://prime.tmdata.io/plutus/api/v1/files/download?name=dataos-ctl-windows-amd64.tar.gz&dir=cli-apps-2.8&apikey=abcdefgh12345678987654321
    ```

3. *Optional step*: Download the checksum .shasum file using the following link in a browser (replace the **`ARCH`**, **`CLI_VERSION`**, and **`PRIME_APIKEY`** with respective values).
    ```
    https://prime.tmdata.io/plutus/api/v1/files/download?name=dataos-ctl-windows-{{ARCH}}.tar.gz.sha256sum&dir=cli-apps-{{CLI_VERSION}}&apikey={{PRIME_APIKEY}}
    ```
    Example:

    To install CLI version 2.8 for a windows machine with amd64 processor and Prime Apikey as abcdefgh12345678987654321, run the following command.

    ``` 
    https://prime.tmdata.io/plutus/api/v1/files/download?name=dataos-ctl-windows-amd64.tar.gz.sha256sum&dir=cli-apps-2.8&apikey=abcdefgh12345678987654321
    ```
    <aside class="callout">üó£Ô∏è Contact the admin(operator in your organization) to get the latest version of the CLI</aside>


4. *Optional step*: Validate that the .tar file has not been tampered with. Replace the **`tar-file-path`** with the path of the downloaded tar file. Also, open the .shasum file in a text editor and copy the hash value and paste it inside quotes in place of **`hash-value-from-shasum-file`**.
    ```
    (Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256 -Path {{tar-file-path}}).hash -eq '{{hash-value-from-shasum-file}}'
   
    ```
    Example:

    ```
    (Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256 -Path ./Downloads/dataos-ctl-windows-amd64.tar.gz).hash -eq '7d48cb3f60ab4821dd69dddd6291'
    ```

    Sample output:
   
    If the value is True, validation is successful.
   
5. The next step is to unzip the downloaded .tar file. To extract it, you will need an archiver utility like Winrar. 

6. Open Winrar and highlight the zipped .tar file (it should appear with other downloaded files in the lower part of the page), and click the **‚ÄúExtract to‚Äù** button on the top. Place it in your chosen directory. 

   You will always use this directory to run DataOS. 
   
   To open the DataOS from anywhere in the system, place the extracted file in a directory that is in your PATH. To add the directory in PATH, refer to [Setting the Path and Variables in Windows](/interfaces/cli/windows_path_setting/).

   > Important: If you have not added the directory containing the dataos-ctl executable to your PATH variables, you must use `.\dataos-ctl `to run the command. Once you add the directory to the PATH variable, you can simply use `dataos-ctl` from any location.

You have successfully installed the CLI, now the next step is to initialize the DataOS context.
