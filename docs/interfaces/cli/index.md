# :octicons-terminal-16: CLI

DataOS CLI is a text-based interface that allows users to interact with the DataOS context via command prompts. It offers a consistent experience across operating systems like MacOS, Linux, and Windows.

CLI provides several capabilities - programmable command completion, passing environment variables while creating or updating the configuration files, managing multiple DataOS contexts from a central location, a Terminal User Interface (TUI), and a host of other features.

The following documents encapsulate the installation steps for CLI, initialization steps for the DataOS context, and the shell grammar for first-time users to understand the command structure.
