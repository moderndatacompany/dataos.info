# Pre-defined Roles and Policies

Metis supports defining roles and policies for metadata operations. AÂ user can be assignedÂ roles. The policies define the set of permissions in the form of rules about what users can do with metadata, for example, whether users can only view metadata or update tags, add descriptions to data assets, change owners, or create a glossary.

Once the Metis admin creates these roles and policies, roles can be assigned to users on Metis UI.

## Getting Admin Role

To provide admin access for Metis to a user, grant the `authorize-metis-root-access` ****use case to the user.

In metis, a user must have `Admin` role to configure roles and policies for performing metadata operation. A dataOS user having `operator` tag has complete access to Metis. He is 'Admin' of Metis by default.On Metis UI, Admin can assign 'Admin' role to other users to allow them to configure roles and policies.
Users other than Admin can also create roles and policies in Metis ****if they have specific use case permissions that allow them to create roles and policies.
