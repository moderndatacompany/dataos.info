# Pre-defined Roles and Policies

Metis supports defining roles and policies for metadata operations. AÂ user can be assignedÂ roles. The policies define the set of permissions in the form of rules about what users can do with metadata, for example, whether users can only view metadata or update tags, add descriptions to data assets, change owners, or create a glossary.

In metis, a user must have `Admin` role to configure roles and policies for performing metadata operation. Once the Metis admin creates these roles and policies, roles can be assigned to users on Metis UI.

## Getting Admin Role

A DataOS user  with the `roles:id:operator` tag are designated as dataOS operators. These operators possess full access privileges within the Metis component and are automatically assigned the 'Admin' role. 

Within the Metis user interface (UI), users holding the 'Admin' role enjoy additional privileges, including the ability to assign the `Admin` role to other users. It's important to note that these users being assigned the `Admin` role may not necessarily possess the `roles:id:operator` tag. By granting the 'Admin' role to other users, they are empowered with the capability to create roles and policies within Metis.
