# Navigating Metis UI

Metis is a one-stop solution for data discoverability and managing all aspects of the data ecosystem. Metis UI  helps users search, discover, understand, and trust **data** **assets** (tables, topics, dashboards, etc.), **DataOS Resources** (Workflows, Services, Stacks, etc.) and Data Products that exist for the entire organization. Users can easily collaborate with other team members, inform them about the updates on these assets, observe the changes in the metadata through versions, and accomplish more.

## Metis UI Homepage

The homepage of Metis UI showcases a comprehensive overview of activities related to your data entities (Data products, data assets and DataOS Resources). Users can navigate through and interact with these entities for further exploration and management.

This document will cover the essential details about how to perform various functionalities, such as adding a glossary, starting conversations for collaboration, and many more.

## Adding Tag Categories, Tags, and Glossary

Tags and glossary terms are two distinct and impactful features, each serving a unique purpose. Although they may appear similar at first glance, they are designed for different applications. Tags are labels that provide valuable assistance to individuals and groups, acting as helpful aids in discoverability. On the other hand, glossary terms play a crucial role in maintaining consistency across the entire company, ensuring the usage of common vocabulary.

Here are some scenarios where using these terms can be powerful:

- Labeling datasets with concepts that are relevant to the business/industry - Glossary
- Labeling a data asset with sensitivity information (PII, Highly sensitive, etc.)- Tag Category
- Applying Gold/Silver/Bronze data-tier labels based on centrally defined standards- Tag Category

<aside class="callout">
ðŸ—£ To maintain a well-organized business glossary, we recommend limiting the creation permissions for glossary terms to administrators or a designated Data Governance lead. Enabling this permission for too many end-users could potentially lead to a disorganized and cluttered glossary.

</aside>

### **How to Define Tag Groups**

1. On Metis UI, click on **Govern â†’Tag Groups**. 
    
<center>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="/interfaces/metis/navigating_metis_ui_how_to_guide/tag_groups.png" alt="Tag groups" style="border:1px solid black; width: 80%; height: auto">
    <figcaption>Tag groups</figcaption>
  </div>
</center>

    
2. Clicking on the + Add Tag will open the screen to add a new tag group and its description.
    
     
    
<center>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="/interfaces/metis/navigating_metis_ui_how_to_guide/new_tag_group.png" alt="New tag group creation" style="border:1px solid black; width: 80%; height: auto">
    <figcaption>New tag group creation</figcaption>
  </div>
</center>

    
3. Enable **Mutually Exclusive** Property to designate tag groups as mutually exclusive. When a tag group is marked as mutually exclusive, it implies that a metadata entity can be tagged to belong to one of the available tags defined in the group.  To learn more, refer to [Mutually Exclusive Tag Groups](/interfaces/metis/metis_features/#mutually-exclusive-tag-groups). 
4. Add new tags with proper descriptions for the newly added category and save them. Now, these tags can be added to the data entities.

<aside class="callout">
ðŸ—£ You can define new tag categories as per business requirements, but some of the tag categories, such as tag tiers, are pre-defined by the Metis administrator with special business importance terms, Gold, Silver, etc. Click **here** to learn more about it.

</aside>

### **How to Create a Glossary**

1. On Metis UI, click on **Govern â†’** **Glossary**.
2. Clicking on + Add Glossary will open up the following form:
    
<center>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="/interfaces/metis/navigating_metis_ui_how_to_guide/add_glossary.png" alt="Adding glossary" style="border:1px solid black; width: 80%; height: auto">
    <figcaption>Adding glossary</figcaption>
  </div>
</center>

    
3. Enable Mutually Exclusive Property to designate the glossary as mutually exclusive. When a Glossary is marked as mutually exclusive, it implies that a metadata entity can be tagged to any of the single glossary terms.  It can not have two or more glossary terms attached to it simultaneously.
4. Add owners and reviewers and save it. Your glossary will appear on the left pane.

#### **How to Add Glossary Terms**
1. To create a glossary term, selectÂ the newly added glossaryÂ on the left pane and then select theÂ **Add term**Â button on the page.
2. Give this new term a name, which must be unique in the glossary. 
    
<center>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="/interfaces/metis/navigating_metis_ui_how_to_guide/add_glossary_term.png" alt="Adding references and synonyms for the glossary term" style="border:1px solid black; width: 80%; height: auto">
    <figcaption>Adding references and synonyms for the glossary term</figcaption>
  </div>
</center>

    
    > Metis enables you to add rich formatting to glossary term. For example, you can add `bold`, `underline`, or `italic` formatting to the text. You can also create tables, bulleted lists, or hyperlinks to external resources.
    > 
    
3. You can add synonyms, the other terms used for the same term, such as for customer, you can add client, buyer, etc.
4. You can add related terms for the term, such as for customer, you can add related terms â€˜loyalâ€™, â€˜preferredâ€™, â€˜high-importanceâ€™, etc.
5. Add links from where you inherited the term.
6. Add the tags which are alreday existing in DataOS
7. A term also has a set ofÂ **Reviewers** who review and accept the changes to the Glossary. This is to ensure the consistent use of terms across the organization. 

### **How to Bulk Upload Glossary**

Metis facilitates a **Glossary Bulk Upload** feature. During the bulk upload process, Owners and Reviewers can be specified. These designated individuals will then be automatically associated with each glossary term, streamlining the management and oversight of the entire glossary.

To import a glossary into Metis:

1. Navigate toÂ **Govern > Glossary**.
    
2. Click on theÂ **â‹®**Â icon andÂ **Export**Â the glossary file. If you have glossary terms in your Glossary, the same will be exported as a CSV file. If there are no terms in the Glossary, then a blank CSV template will be downloaded.
    
<center>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="/interfaces/metis/navigating_metis_ui_how_to_guide/glossary_add_term_option.png" alt="Glossary options" style="border:1px solid black; width: 80%; height: auto">
    <figcaption>Glossary options</figcaption>
  </div>
</center>

    
3. Once you have the template, you can fill in the following details:
    - **parent**Â - The parent column helps to define the hierarchy of the glossary terms. If you leave this field blank, the Term will be created at the root level. If you want to create a hierarchy of Glossary Terms, the parent details must be entered as per the hierarchy. For example, from the Glossary level,Â `Banking.Account.Savings Account`
    - **name**- This contains the name of the glossary term, and is a required field.
    - **displayName**Â - This contains the Display name of the glossary term.
    - **description**- This contains the description or details of the glossary term and is a required field.
    - **synonyms**Â - Include words that have the same meaning as the glossary term. E.g., for the term â€˜Customerâ€™, the synonyms can be â€˜Clientâ€™, â€˜Buyerâ€™, or â€˜Purchaserâ€™. In the CSV file, the synonyms must be separated by a semicolon (;) as inÂ `Client; Buyer;Purchaser`
    - **related terms**Â - A term that has a related concept as the glossary term. This term must be available in Metis. E.g., for the term â€˜Customerâ€™, the related terms can be â€˜Customer LTV (LifeTime Value)â€™, and â€˜Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)â€™. In the CSV file, the related terms must contain the hierarchy, which is separated by a full stop (.). Multiple terms must be separated by a semicolon (;) as inÂ `Banking.Account.Savings account;Banking.Debit card`
    - **references**Â - Add links from the internet from where you inherited the term. In the CSV file, the references must be in the format (name;url;name;url)Â `IBM;https://www.ibm.com/;World Bank;https://www.worldbank.org/`
    - **tags**Â - Add the tags which are already existing in Metis. In the CSV file, the tags must be in the formatÂ `PII.Sensitive;PersonalData.Personal`
    
4. Once you have added the values for the above fields in CSV you can upload it via **Import** option.

## How to Create Roles and Policies

The Metis administrator has to decide on the roles users must be given along with the set of permissions for the roles. Permissions are a set of rules pertaining to various metadata operations that can be performed using Metis UI and APIs. These permissions are part of the policies corresponding to each role. When users are assigned roles, they automatically get the permissions defined for the roles.

[Pre-defined Roles and Policies](/interfaces/metis/navigating_metis_ui_how_to_guide/pre_defined_roles_and_policies/)

<aside class="callout">
ðŸ—£ Metis Admins have access to define newÂ roles and their associatedÂ permissions. Once roles and permissions are in line with organization/business requirements, Metis admin can assignÂ Roles toÂ Users.

</aside>

## How to Add Configured Roles for Users

Roles can be assigned from the user profile on the Metis UI.

1. On the Metis UI page, navigate to the **Settings** tab. 
2. Clicking on the **Users** in the left pane will show the list of users. Open the specific userâ€™s profile. In the left pane, edit the roles given to the user. A drop-down list will show the configured roles to choose from.

<aside class="callout">
ðŸ—£ The Metis Admin role can be given from the Metis UI by a user with â€˜Adminâ€™ privileges. You can also contact the DataOS system administrator to assign you the â€˜**Admin**â€™ role by adding the `roles:direct:metis` tag to your DataOS user profile.

</aside>

## How to Get Data Profile Information

Data profiling workflow analyzes the valid formats, null and inconsistent values within data to uncover anomalies and redundancies to achieve higher data quality. It uses basic statistics to gain insight about the validity of the data. The Data Profile scan workflow reads data profiling statistics and saves this information into Metis DB, which can be accessed on Metis UI.

1. Search the dataset for which you want to view the data profiling results.
2. Click on the **Profiler & Data Quality tab on the DataOS entity detailspage**.
3. You will see the data profiling statistics for the columns. It gives data types, null values %, distinct value %, and unique values % for each column. It also shows you â€˜value countâ€™, which helps you to know the completeness and missing values for the column before you use the data for critical business use cases.
4. Click on a column to see more details on the statistical distribution of its values.  You need to select the time period to see all the test results run for the particular column of the dataset.

## How to Get Fingerprinting Information

Fingerprinting analyzes the data to know that a column of data has a signature or a pattern. By examining the data values in a column, it can identify what type of data is there and determine what business terms or labels can be attached to this data. Fingerprinting automates identifying sensitive data (PII tag)that needs to be secured and to comply with government regulations like the GDPR. 

This information is shown on the Metis UI for your dataset.

On the DataOS entity detailspage, you will see the following fingerprinting data for your dataset.

1. Column names for which fingerprinting is performed.
2. Label showing the labels identified in the data. These labels are defined as system labels or according to business value.
3. For each label, you will get an option to **accept** the label to tag the fingerprint to the column or **discard** the label.
4. The confidence score reflects the system's degree of certainty that the identified label/classification is correct.
5. Once you accept the label, it will be added as a tag to the column.
