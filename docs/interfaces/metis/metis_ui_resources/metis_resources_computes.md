# Metadata of Computes on Metis UI

<aside class="callout">
üó£ This page guides you on exploring and managing metadata for Computes on Metis. To learn in detail about the Compute as a  DataOS Resource, refer to this <a href="/resources/compute/">link</a>.

</aside>

Metis has integrated "Compute" as a "Resource‚Äù type entity for storing metadata pertaining to its attributes, real-time status, user engagements, manifest details, and more. This metadata plays a crucial role in tracking and management of resources within the Metis platform.

On selecting **Computes,** the following information will appear on the screen:

| Show Deleted | Set the toggle to list deleted Computes. |
| Domain | Domain associated |
| Owner | Filter the list based on the user who created the Worker Resource. |
| Tier | Filter the list for tiers. |

## Result pane

Here, compute resources will be listed. Users have the following options to customize how the list is displayed:

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Sorting | Choose the Sorting order
