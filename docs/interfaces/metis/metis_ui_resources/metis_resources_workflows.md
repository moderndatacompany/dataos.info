# Metadata of Workflows on Metis UI

<aside class="callout">
üó£ This page guides you on exploring and managing metadata for Workflows on Metis. To learn in detail about the Workflow as a Resource, refer to this <a href="/resources/workflow/">link</a>.

</aside>

Metis has integrated "Workflow" as a "Resource‚Äù  type entity for storing metadata related to its source and transformations within DataOS. On selecting **Workflows,** the following information will be presented on the screen:

### **Jobs**

**Dag** 

A Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is a conceptual representation of a sequence of jobs or activities. In a DAG, these jobs are executed in the order of their dependencies.

**List**

In this section, you can view a list of jobs, along with their names and descriptions, that are part of the workflow.

Click on a job to learn more about the following:

- [Details](/interfaces/metis/metis_ui_resources/metis_resources_workflows/)
- [Topology](/interfaces/metis/metis_ui_resources/metis_resources_workflows/)
