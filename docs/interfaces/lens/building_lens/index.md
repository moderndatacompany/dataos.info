# Building Lens
Creating Lenses involves several key steps. Here's a structured guide to help you navigate the process.
## Lens Modeling

### **Understanding Key Questions and Metrics**

Before diving into lens modeling, it's essential to have a clear understanding of the questions you aim to address and the metrics required. Think about the aspects of your data that you want to analyze. For example, if you're working with sales data, you might want to know which products are selling best in different regions or which customers are making the most significant purchases. This outcome-oriented approach ensures that your lens aligns with your specific needs. So, you need to list the critical questions.

**Example:** In the retail industry, which provides consumers with access to a diverse range of products and services across the globe, the following are the critical concerns:

- Which products do users prefer in particular cities or states?
- In which state are these products most frequently sold?
- Who are the top users of these products?
- Which types of retailers sell particular categories of products?
- What are the most recent orders?

### **Understanding Data Elements**

Begin by comprehending the data you're working with. DataOS Lens is composed of elements such as entities, relationships, fields, dimensions, and measures. The objective of these elements is to define the structure and logic of data models. These elements help develop a conceptual and logical data model that, when mapped to physical data, will enable meaningful insights from raw data, supporting decision-making processes.

- **Entities** are logical representations of an organization‚Äôs widely referred to and analyzed business concepts. They are the subjects or actors in the data. In the context of this use case, three primary entities are  `Retailer`, `Order`, and `Product`
- **Fields**, also known as attributes or columns, are individual data elements within an entity. Each field represents a specific piece of information about the entity.  They are columns that uniquely identify an entity. For instance, in the "Retailer" entity, fields might include "retailer_id",  ‚Äúname", and "customer email‚Äù. In our use case, `retailer_id` and `product_id` are fields.
- **Dimensions** are categorical or qualitative attributes that provide context for measures. They describe the various ways data can be categorized or grouped. In an `Order` dataset, dimensions could include `order_date`, `product_category`, or geographic location such as `city`. Dimensions allow for slicing and dicing data to gain different perspectives or aggregations.
- **Measures** are quantitative, numerical values that can be aggregated or computed for analysis. They represent metrics or calculations based on fields and dimensions. Common measures include "total sales," "average customer age," or "maximum order quantity.‚ÄùTo solve our use case, we need to define measures like `total_retailers`, `total_order_quantity`, etc.
- **Relationships** between two entities can be one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-one. A defined relationship simplifies querying dimensions and measures from multiple entities. Entities would be joined based on the defined keys and relationships. In our use case, there are two relationships
    - Retailer and Order Entity are joined on `retailer_id` in a one-to-many relationship
    - Order and Product Entity are joined on `product_id` in a many-to-one relationship

## Creating a Data Model for Lens

The thumb rule for data modeling is to first define what your model would look like, what entities you need that are relevant to answering all your data questions, and how different entities would relate to each other. To achieve this, create a logical schema as the foundation, which can then be customized to create specific Lenses tailored to various use cases.

Begin with the following steps:

1. **Identify Key Questions:** Consider the key questions you need to answer with your lens. These questions can cover a wide range of aspects, including:
    
    a. **Customer Behavior:** Understand customer behaviour by identifying metrics like the customer with the longest lifespan in months, the most frequently purchased items, and preferred products.
    
    b. **Product Performance:** Evaluate product performance by identifying the top-selling products and those that are underperforming.
    
    c. **Product Quality:** Assess product quality by analyzing customer returns. Determine how frequently customers return purchased items.
    
    d. **Pricing Strategy:** Examine the impact of pricing changes on sales and profit margins. Investigate the influence of discounts on revenue generation.
    
    e. **Geographical Analysis:** Explore regional variations in product preferences and purchasing behaviour to gain insights into your market.
    
    These questions will help you identify the dimensions and measures (aggregated metrics like sales revenue, profit margin, and customer count) you need to include in your data lens.
    
2. **Understand Your Data:** This involves identifying the various entities or business objects within your dataset. These could be products, customers, orders, suppliers, or any other relevant entities.
3. **Select Relevant Attributes:** Once you've pinpointed your key questions, select attributes (columns) from your entities that are relevant to answering those questions. These attributes will serve as your fields, such as product_id, type, product_name, etc or if you're interested in regional sales, you'd likely include attributes like "region" or "city."
4. **Evaluate Data Granularity:** Think about the level of detail or granularity you need for your dimensions. These dimensions are columns containing categorical and qualitative data. Depending on your questions, you might choose dimensions that provide data at different levels, such as daily, monthly, or yearly. 
5. **Consider Derived Dimensions:** In some cases, you may need dimensions that don't directly exist in your dataset but can be derived from existing data using SQL expressions. For instance, you might calculate a "profit margin" dimension based on the "revenue" and "cost" columns. Define them under dimensions. 
6. **Decide the metrics**: Measures serve as a way to define specific business metrics based on aggregated data. To understand measures, think of them as aggregated numerical values derived from quantitative columns in the underlying table.
7. **Identify Relationships:** You have identified entities and their attributes, but querying individual entities to arrive at answers isn‚Äôt enough. We need a holistic view, and for that, we need to join these entities together.

**Here's a summary of entities and their attributes for the retail industry use case:**

| Entity | Related To | Relationship | Fields and Dimensions | Measure |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Retailer | Order | 1:N | retailer_id, type, name, chain, state, city | total_retailers |
| Order | Product | N:1 | order_id, retailer_id, order_date, inline_item_number, product_id, quantities, order_line_no | total_orders, total_order_quantity, recency |
| Product |  |  | product_id, product_name, product_category, disease_name | total_products |

For a deep dive into the data modeling concepts, we recommend referring to the comprehensive guide on [Data Modeling](/interfaces/lens/building_lens/data_modeling_concepts/).

### **YAML Syntax for Data Modeling**

This forms the foundation for our Lens definition. Data engineers will expand upon it by establishing mappings to physical data using SQL.

## Defining Lens

Once your logical data model is in place, data engineers can start referring to it to construct Lens. Lens maps the attributes to the physical data.

### **Syntax of a Lens YAML**

![lens-yaml-skeleton.png](/interfaces/lens/building_lens/lens-yaml-skeleton.png)

### **Creating a Lens YAML**

To create a Lens, you need to configure the attributes of various sections within a Lens YAML. The sections are provided below:

- [Lens Meta section](/interfaces/lens/building_lens/attributes_lens/)
- [Entities section](/interfaces/lens/building_lens/attributes_lens/)
    - [SQL](/interfaces/lens/building_lens/attributes_lens/)
    - [Fields](/interfaces/lens/building_lens/attributes_lens/)
    - [Dimensions](/interfaces/lens/building_lens/attributes_lens/)
    - [Measures](/interfaces/lens/building_lens/attributes_lens/)
    - [Relationships](/interfaces/lens/building_lens/attributes_lens/)

<aside class="callout">
üó£ Best practice: It's often a good practice to start with a set of dimensions, build your lens, and then refine your dimensions based on the insights you gain and the specific needs of your business.

## Deploying Lens

After defining the Lens, the next step is to deploy it into the DataOS environment. To get started, follow the steps:

**Step 1: Get the Environment Token or API Key**

- Get the environment token or API Key from the profile section of the current environment.  To get  the API Key from DataOS, click [here](/interfaces/#create-tokens-using-cli).
    

**Step 2: Install Postman**

- Install Postman from the following [link](https://www.postman.com/downloads/):
- After completing the installation, you can begin building and exploring Lenses using Postman.

**Step 3: Building and Exploring Lenses** 

Create a lens or update an existing Lens.

- In the ‚Äò**Headers**‚Äô section, add the following headers:
    
    ![Untitled](/interfaces/lens/building_lens/untitled.png)
    
- Write Lens in the ‚Äò**Body**‚Äô Section. Choose ‚Äò**raw**‚Äô as the text format
- In the ‚Äò**Param**‚Äô section, select dryrun=false.
- To upsert the Lens:
    - Select **PUT.**
    - Add the following URL - `https://{{dataos-instance}}/lens/api/v1/lenses?dryrun=false` and click on the ‚Äò**Send**‚Äô button.
        
        Example: *https://enough-kingfish.dataos.app/lens/api/v1/lenses?dryrun=false*
        
    
    ![Untitled](/interfaces/lens/building_lens/untitled_1.png)
    

## Querying Lens

Once you've successfully deployed the Lens, you can begin querying and exploring it within the DataOS environment. You have two primary options for this:

1. **Lens Explorer**: You can use Lens Explorer, which provides a user-friendly, low-code interface for exploring modeled ontologies.
2. **Lens Query (Abstracted SQL)**: Alternatively, you can utilize Lens Query, an abstracted SQL query language, via the WorkBench tool for more advanced querying and exploration.

<aside class="callout">
üó£ Lens queries can also be executed directly within DataOS Atlas and Notebook.

</aside>

Let‚Äôs explore an analytical question through Lens Query:

> **Data Question**<br><i>Explore the states where the total order quantity was more than 100,000 in the disease product category.</i>
>

**Using Lens Explorer**

- Select the Lens and navigate to the **Explorer** section.
- Within the Lens Explorer, choose the state from `Retailer` and the total order quantity measure from `Order` Entities.
- To add a filter, open the Filter Pane, add a new rule to the Dimensions, select `product.product_category` and select the ‚Äò==‚Äô symbol, and type disease in the adjacent box (REMEMBER: though it‚Äôs a string, don‚Äôt use single or double quotes while typing disease)
- To narrow down to states with more than 100,000 orders, add a rule to the Measures section and choose the measure `order.total_order_quantity`, then select the ‚Äò>‚Äô symbol and type 100000 in the adjacent box (don‚Äôt use quotes).
- Now click **Run Query.**

    The table in the diagram above displays states with total order quantities exceeding one hundred thousand. Additionally, there's a customizable bar chart at the bottom that you can configure and export according to your requirements.
    

**Using Lens Query in Workbench**

- Open the Workbench from the Main Menu and execute the below Lens Query
    
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM LENS (SELECT "order.total_order_quantity","retailer.state" FROM retail WHERE "product.product_category" = 'disease') WHERE "order.total_order_quantity" > 100000
    ```
    
- You will get a table showing states with a total order quantity of more than 100 thousand in the specific product category.
    
    The pre-modeled Lens opens up possibilities for addressing various use cases. In case the existing Lens doesn't meet your current requirements, you have the flexibility to create a new lens or introduce new entities as needed.
    

## Dynamic Parameters

Sometimes, you may need to customize the results of your query based on specific inputs at runtime. For instance, you might want to see the running total of items sold for a particular product category or the monthly active users for a specific month. However, you want the flexibility to define these parameters at runtime. This is where you can use dynamic parameters, 'params'. You can include these params in your Lens definition.

When you want to input values during the query execution, 'params' should be employed. Define these parameters in the fields, dimensions, or measures where you intend to use them.

Consider this example, where we want to find the monthly active user and let the month be defined during the query time, for which we need the count of users.  We have defined a measure month active users, and to define param to get month input during the query time, we use the following format: `{{key:value}}`.

Let's take an example where we aim to find the monthly active users, and we want to specify the month when executing the query to obtain the user count. To achieve this, we have created a measure called "monthly active users." To define a parameter that allows us to input the month during the query execution, we use the following format: {{key:value}}.

```yaml
measures:
  - name: monthly_active_user
    type: count
    sql_snippet: case when month(${visitedcampaign.ts_}) = {{month:2}}  then entity_id else null end
```

The value given here will be the default value.

üó£ Note: Do not use ‚Äòkey‚Äô while defining the parameter name, it‚Äôs a reserved keyword

</aside>

And while running this query on the Workbench, you can input the parameters as follows:

```sql
LENS (
    SELECT      
     visitedcampaign.monthly_active_users
    FROM
test_extend  
# give params input as follows
PARAMS (month=3)
)
```

> On Lens Explorer, you will get an additional input box for the parameter to provide a new value.
> 

Params are useful to power multiple use cases without having to define multiple measures or dimensions per use case. In the following article, we will demonstrate how Params can be leveraged in different scenarios.
