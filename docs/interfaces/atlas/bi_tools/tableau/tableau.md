# DataOS Integration with Tableau

This article will help you to set up the connection between DataOS and Tableau. It provides specific steps needed to fetch data from DataOS into Tableau.

## Explore your DataOS data with Tableau

Tableau is one of the most powerful business intelligence tools which allows you to pull vast amounts of information from disparate sources, and helps you turn it into advanced visualizations. The dashboard created from these visualizations empowers you with business insights and helps in data-driven decisions.

DataOS and Tableau integration work to take advantage of that powerful visualization technology on the data pulled from DataOS.

## Requirements

- Tableau Desktop installed on your system - If Tableau is not installed on your system, you can download the latest version from the [Tableau website](https://www.tableau.com/products/desktop/download).
- Java installed on your system- you can download the latest version from the [Latest Oracle Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk17-mac).
- Driver - In order to connect to DataOS Catalog, you would have to install the driver.
- DataOS API token - To authenticate and access DataOS, you need an API token.

## Download and install the driver

Check your Tableau version and follow the steps given below:

- Tableau: 2021.3, 2021.2.2, 2021.1.5, 2020.4.8, 2020.3.12, and above
    
    a. Download the driver (for example, trino-jdbc-373.jar) from the [Trino](https://trino.io/docs/current/client/jdbc.html) [](https://trino.io/docs/current/installation/jdbc.html)page. Please note that Presto is Trino now.
    
    b. Copy the downloaded JAR file to the appropriate location.
    
    - ~/Library/Tableau/Drivers for MAC
    - C:\Program Files\Tableau\Drivers for WINDOWS
