# ABAC Implementation in DataOS

An access policy in DataOS defines permissions based on the ABAC authorization strategy. In ABAC (Attribute-based Access Control), the subject and objects of the policy are identified by their attributes. An attribute in Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) refers to any characteristic or property utilized to regulate access, with tags being a common attribute employed to identify subjects and objects. The attributes of both the subject and the object are defined and declared separately. 

## Elements of Access Control in DataOS



| Term           | Description                                                          | Example                                                                               |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Tag-Namespace](/interfaces/bifrost/abac_implementation_in_dataos/#tag-namespace)  | A grouping or container for tags following the same glob pattern.     | `roles:**` or <br> `dataos:system:**`                                                     |
| [Tag](/interfaces/bifrost/abac_implementation_in_dataos/#tags)           | An attribute following a fixed glob pattern, as defined by its Tag-Namespace. | `dataos:layer:user` or <br> `roles:id:operator`                                             |
| [Subject](/interfaces/bifrost/abac_implementation_in_dataos/#subject)         | The user (application or person) who/which wants to perform an action identified by a tag. | - `users:id:metis` (tag identifying Metis application as the user). <br> - `users:id:iamgroot` (tag identifying person with the name Iamgroot as the user). |
| [Object](/interfaces/bifrost/abac_implementation_in_dataos/#object)          | The entity on which the action is to be performed also identified by a tag.               | - `dataos:resource:secret` (the Secret resource-type as the object of the policy). <br> - `/metis/**` (an API path as the object). |
| [Predicate](/interfaces/bifrost/abac_implementation_in_dataos/#predicate)    | The action to be performed.                                         | get, put, post (other HTTP & CRUD operations). |


## Tag-Namespace

A tag-namespace should be thought of as a container for tags. A specific glob pattern defines it. There are three categories of tag-namespaces in DataOS. 

- The ones used to create tags to be assigned to subjects of an access policy. Example `users:id:**` or `roles:id:**`.

- The ones that are to be assigned to the objects. For example, `dataos:domain:**` or 
 `dataos:layer:**`

- The ones that are used to convey non-mandatory information about the subject or object of the policy. For example, `dataos:info:**`

## Tags

Tags serve as identifiers for different types of users, guiding the assignment of policies. These policies are then applied based on the tags associated with each user. Heimdall only recognizes tags categorized within a Tag-Namespace for access policies Based on a particular Use-Case, the system administrator can create all the requisite policies against a tag or a set of tags and apply them. 

For instance, if a particular user John Doe has the following two tags:

`roles:id:data-dev` <br> `roles:direct:metis` <br>  `users:id:testuser`

The policies created with the above-given tags as subjects will apply to John Doe. To remove the access from user John Doe, the policies must be deleted.

## Subject

The user (application or person) who/which wants to perform a certain action.

The attribute of the *subject* of a policy is always identified by a *tag*. For instance, the tag for the user tag namespace is `users:id:**`, similarly for  roles, itâ€™s `roles:id:**`.

## Object

The object is a target resource on which the subject would like to perform actions. A tag or path identifies the object. You can specify multiple tags/paths.

The attribute of the *object* of a policy can be a tag or a path. For instance `users:id:depot-service` is the tag for object depot service  and `/ds/api/v3/**` is the path to the depot service.

## Predicate

A predicate specifies whether an action is permitted or prohibited for a particular subject on a specific object/resource. While you present various potential actions in an list format, only one action will be taken at a time.

For instance, the following tables suggest possible actions in the `predicate` section.

**DataOS User:**


| Action | Description |
| --- | --- |
| create | Creates a new resource (for example dataset on a given path) |
| read | Read the data  |
| update | Update the data |
| delete | Delete the data  |


**DataOS Applications can perform API operations on resources:**


| Action | Description |
| --- | --- |
| get | Returns the resource(content/data) |
| post | Creates a new resource |
| put | Updates resources by replacing the resource information/content/data |
| patch | Modifies resource content |
| delete | Removes resource entirely |
