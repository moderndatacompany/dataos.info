A role in DataOS is a tag present in the tag-namespace called roles, with the glob `roles:**`. It is a way to group two or more subjects that need to share the same level of access to various entities in the ecosystem. The idea of granting same-level access to specific users becomes especially valuable for some particular scenarios.

For instance, when a new project is initiated within your company, involving specific users or team members assigned to work on it, and these individuals or roles require access to the same level of access for project completion, an alternative approach can be adopted. Instead of granting individual access to each person involved in the project, a new role can be created. Subsequently, users can be added to this role. For instance, if the project pertains to the marketing team, the role tag could be defined as `roles:id:marketing:userid`, indicating that this role is specific to the marketing project, granting access to the dataset within a particular database.

The Roles page provides a comprehensive view of system default roles alongside custom roles tailored for specific use cases or as per organizational needs.
