In this section, we will explore a recipe to explore Data Product Hub.

## Problem Statement

John, a senior investment analyst at a finance company, aims to assess investor risk, evaluate company valuations, and identify high-potential companies for hedge fund portfolios. To achieve this, he will collaborate with Max, a data analyst, to create a comprehensive dashboard for corporate performance and hedge fund metrics, to optimize investment strategies and manage risk effectively. Following are the key areas that need to be highlighted:

1. **Performance by Industry and Sector:** Assess the performance of different industries and sectors to identify trends and areas for investment opportunities. 
2. **Top-Performing Companies:** Identify which companies are performing best in terms of key financial indicators.
3. **Revenue and Financial Impact Analysis:** Analyze revenue and financial metrics to understand the impact of each company on overall portfolio performance.
4. **Operational Efficiency Metrics:** Determine operational efficiency to gauge financial health and identify areas for operational improvements.
5. **Debt and Risk Analysis:** Compare companies based on their debt levels to manage investment risk and optimize portfolio allocation.
6. **Financial Growth Patterns:** Identify patterns in financial growth to uncover potential investment opportunities and refine strategies.
7. **Hedge Fund Metrics Overview:** Compare hedge fund metrics to optimize investment decisions and manage fund performance.
8. **Regional Performance Comparison:** Compare the performance of companies across different countries to identify regional trends and opportunities.
9. **Investor Risk Assessment:** Use financial metrics to assess and manage investor risk within the portfolio.

The goal is to enhance their ability to assess corporate performance, manage hedge fund metrics, and optimize investment strategies, leading to improved decision-making and portfolio performance.

## Discovering a Data Product

To solve the problem, Max uses the Data Product Hub, a Graphical User Interface within DataOS where data analysts can discover actionable [Data Products](/products/data_product/). Max follows the steps below to identify the potential Data Products to solve his use case.

1. To get started with the Data Product Hub, Max clicks on theÂ **Data Product Hub 2.0** within the DataOS User Interface.

## Exploring the Data Product

After successfully setting up the dashboard with the relevant data products, Max wants to take the analysis one step further by adding forecasting capabilities to predict future trends for their hedge fund portfolio. This will help John make informed investment decisions and anticipate potential risks. for which Max followed the below steps:

1. Max goes back to the Data Product Hub and continues his data analysis journey, by clicking on the â€˜Exploreâ€™ button an interface will open where he can perform cross Data Product analysis and determine if he has enough data to build a forecast model.
    
    <center>
    <img src="/interfaces/data_product_hub/recipe/image%20(36).png" alt="DPH" style="width:50rem; border: 1px solid black;" />
    </center>  
        
    - Max begins by comparing the **Corp Market Performance** and **Corp Performance** data products to analyze how companies perform across different **industries and sectors**. He focuses on metrics like **net income**, **revenue growth**, and **operational efficiency** to understand which companies in various sectors are delivering the strongest financial results.
        
        <center>
        <img src="/interfaces/data_product_hub/recipe/image%20(37).png" alt="DPH" style="width:50rem; border: 1px solid black;" />
        </center>  
        
    - He filters the data to focus on specific sectors such as â€˜Financial Servicesâ€™, identifying the companies with the highest **earnings per share** and **net income**. This helps him narrow down high-performing companies that should be prioritized for hedge fund allocation.
        
        <center>
        <img src="/interfaces/data_product_hub/recipe/image%20(38).png" alt="DPH" style="width:50rem; border: 1px solid black;" />

    </center>  
        
3. He chooses to go with REST API templates. Which looks like the following.
    - REST API template
        
        ```python
        # Import necessary libraries
        import requests
        import pandas as pd
        import json
        
        # API URL and API key
        api_url = "https://lucky-possum.dataos.app/lens2/api/public:company-intelligence/v2/load"
        apikey = 'api key here'
        
        # API payload, enter YOUR_QUERY here.
        payload = json.dumps({
            "query": {
                YOUR_QUERY
            }
        })
        
        # Query Example: This is how your query should look like.
        
            # "query": {
            #     "measures": [
            #         "sales.total_quantities_sold", 
            #         "sales.proof_revenue"
            #     ],
            #     "dimensions": [
            #         "inventory.warehouse"
            #     ],
            #     "timeDimensions": [
            #         {
            #             "dimension": "sales.invoice_date",
            #             "granularity": "day"
            #         }
            #     ],
            #     "limit": 1000,
            #     "responseFormat": "compact"
            # }
        
        # Headers
        headers = {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
            'apikey': apikey
        }
        
        # Fetch data from API
        def fetch_data_from_api(api_url, payload, headers=None):
            response = requests.post(api_url, headers=headers, data=payload)
            
            if response.status_code == 200:
                data = response.json()
                df = pd.json_normalize(data['data'])  # Create DataFrame
                return df
            else:
                print(f"Error: {response.status_code}")
                return None
        
        # Main execution
        if __name__ == "__main__":
            data = fetch_data_from_api(api_url, payload, headers=headers)
            
            if data is not None:
                print("Data Frame Created:")
                print(data.head())  # Show the first few rows of the DataFrame
                print("Ready for AI/ML model building.")
            else:
                print("Failed to fetch data.")
        
        ```
        
4. In the template, Max got to know that he needed to provide the API URL as api_url and the DataOS API key as apikey for which in DPH he navigated to the Data APIs section from where he downloaded the Postman collection and OpenAPI specification to explore and test the API endpoint.

7. Now he provided the API URL and API key on the REST API template and executed the code. Max is ready to build a Forecasting model.

8. Then Max requested **Eric, the Data Product owner** to include columns related to forecasting in the 'Corp Performance' data product.

Through his thorough exploration and utilization of Data Product Hub within DataOS, Max successfully discovers and activates relevant data products like **Corp Market Performance** and **Corp Performance**. By leveraging these Data Products, he provides John, the senior investment analyst, with key insights into corporate performance, industry trends, and operational efficiency, enabling data-driven decision-making for hedge fund strategies.

Max's ability to integrate data with Tableau Cloud for seamless dashboard creation and his use of Jupyter Notebook to build forecasting models demonstrate how effectively DataOS empowers data analysts to manage complex financial use cases. With the added collaboration from the Data Product owner, Eric, to incorporate additional forecasting columns, Max ensures that Johnâ€™s hedge fund strategies are optimized for future growth and risk mitigation.
