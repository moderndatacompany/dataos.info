        import json
        
        # API URL and API key
        api_url = "https://lucky-possum.dataos.app/lens2/api/public:company-intelligence/v2/load"
        apikey = 'api key here'
        
        # API payload, enter YOUR_QUERY here.
        payload = json.dumps({
            "query": {
                YOUR_QUERY
            }
        })
        
        # Headers
        headers = {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
            'apikey': apikey
        }

        # Fetch data from API
        def fetch_data_from_api(api_url, payload, headers=None):
            response is = requests.post(api_url, headers=headers, data=payload)
            
            if response.status_code == 200:
                data = response.json()
                df = pd.json_normalize(data['data'])  # Create DataFrame
                return df
            else:
                print(f"Error: {response.status_code}")
                return None
        
        # Main execution
        if __name__ == "__main__":
            data = fetch_data_from_api(api_url, payload, headers=headers)
            
            if data is not None:
                print("Data Frame Created:")
                print(data.head())  # Show the first few rows of the DataFrame
                print("Ready for AI/ML model building.")
            else:
