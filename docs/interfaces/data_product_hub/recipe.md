3. He chooses to go with REST API templates. Which looks like the following.
    - REST API template
        
        ```python
        # Import necessary libraries
        import requests
        import pandas as pd
        import json
        
        # API URL and API key
        api_url = "https://lucky-possum.dataos.app/lens2/api/public:company-intelligence/v2/load"
        apikey = 'api key here'
        
        # API payload, enter YOUR_QUERY here.
        payload = json.dumps({
            "query": {
                YOUR_QUERY
            }
        })
        
        # Query Example: This is how your query should look like.
        
            # "query": {
            #     "measures": [
            #         "sales.total_quantities_sold", 
            #         "sales.proof_revenue"
            #     ],
            #     "dimensions": [
            #         "inventory.warehouse"
            #     ],
            #     "timeDimensions": [
            #         {
            #             "dimension": "sales.invoice_date",
            #             "granularity": "day"
            #         }
            #     ],
            #     "limit": 1000,
            #     "responseFormat": "compact"
            # }
        
        # Headers
        headers = {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
            'apikey': apikey
        }
        
        # Fetch data from API
        def fetch_data_from_api(api_url, payload, headers=None):
            response = requests.post(api_url, headers=headers, data=payload)
            
            if response.status_code == 200:
                data = response.json()
                df = pd.json_normalize(data['data'])  # Create DataFrame
                return df
            else:
                print(f"Error: {response.status_code}")
                return None
        
        # Main execution
        if __name__ == "__main__":
            data = fetch_data_from_api(api_url, payload, headers=headers)
            
            if data is not None:
                print("Data Frame Created:")
                print(data.head())  # Show the first few rows of the DataFrame
                print("Ready for AI/ML model building.")
            else:
                print("Failed to fetch data.")
        
        ```
        
4. In the template, Max got to know that he needed to provide the API URL as api_url and the DataOS API key as apikey for which in DPH he navigated to the Data APIs section from where he downloaded the Postman collection and OpenAPI specification to explore and test the API endpoint.

5. Max opened the Postman application and imported the Postman collection to test the API endpoint.

1. He copied the base URL, pasted it in place of {{baseUrl}}, provided his DataOS API key as a bearer token, and clicked Send. He found out that the API endpoint was working fine.
1. Now he provided the API URL and API key on the REST API template and executed the code. Max is ready to build a Forecasting model.
2. Then Max requested **Eric, the Data Product owner** to include columns related to forecasting in the 'Corp Performance' data product.

Through his thorough exploration and utilization of Data Product Hub within DataOS, Max successfully discovers and activates relevant data products like **Corp Market Performance** and **Corp Performance**. By leveraging these Data Products, he provides John, the senior investment analyst, with key insights into corporate performance, industry trends, and operational efficiency, enabling data-driven decision-making for hedge fund strategies.

Max's ability to integrate data with Tableau Cloud for seamless dashboard creation and his use of Jupyter Notebook to build forecasting models demonstrate how effectively DataOS empowers data analysts to manage complex financial use cases. With the added collaboration from the Data Product owner, Eric, to incorporate additional forecasting columns, Max ensures that Johnâ€™s hedge fund strategies are optimized for future growth and risk mitigation.
