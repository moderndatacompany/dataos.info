# Postgres integration

You can develop data applications on top of your Data Product by PostgreSQL API endpoint, to do so follow the below steps:

1. Go to the Access Options tab of your Data Product, and navigate to the App Development section.
    
    <center>

    </center>
  
2. To develop data applications using **PostgreSQL** API, You need to choose a PostgreSQL client like `psql` or any other client tool (e.g., pgAdmin, DBeaver) to connect to the database.

3. The connection string below is what youâ€™ll need to connect to the PostgreSQL database. Execute the given string on your terminal, when prompted for a password, you'll enter your DataOS API key. 
    
    <center>
    <img src="/interfaces/data_product_hub/activation/image%20(34).png" alt="DPH" style="width:50rem; border: 1px solid black;" />
    </center>

4. After entering the necessary details, ensure your connection is successful by testing. This makes sure you're connected and ready to start querying data. A successful connection will look like the following where you can start querying:
    
    ```bash
    psql -h tcp.lucky-possum.dataos.app -p 6432 -U iamgroot -d lens:public:company-intelligence~  
    Password for user iamgroot
    psql (14.13 (Ubuntu 14.13-0ubuntu0.22.04.1), server 14.2 (Lens2/public:company-intelligence v0.35.60-8))
    Type "help" for help.
    lens:public:company-intelligence~=> 
    ```
