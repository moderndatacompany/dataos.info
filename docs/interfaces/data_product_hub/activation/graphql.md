# GraphQL integration

You can develop data applications on top of your Data Product by GraphQL API endpoint, to do so follow the below steps:

    
1. To develop the data application using **GraphQL**, click on the ‘Explore’ button as shown below.

    </center>

2. Navigate to the GraphQL tab, start by building your GraphQL query.

    </center>

3. You can also try out the sample query, by clicking on the ‘Try it out’ link in the **Sample Query** section in the **Access Options** tab. It will open the GraphQL playground with a sample query which you can test and then write your queries.

    </center>

4. When you run your query, verify that the data returned matches your expectations. Since GraphQL lets you be very specific in requesting fields, double-check to ensure your query retrieves exactly what you need.

    </center>

5. Copy the provided GraphQL endpoint and the necessary authentication details (DataOS API key) and integrate them into your application, so your app can access the data.
