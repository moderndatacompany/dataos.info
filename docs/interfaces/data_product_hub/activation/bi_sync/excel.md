## Governance of model on Excel

When the Lens Model is activated via BI Sync on Excel, all user-level access controls and data policies from Lens are automatically applied to Tableau.

The process is managed through authentication and authorization using your DataOS user ID and API key when accessing synced data models. This ensures that columns redacted by Lens data policies are restricted based on the user's group permissions. 

For instance, if a user named **iamgroot** in the "**Analyst**" group is restricted from viewing the "Annual Salary" column, they will not see it either in the Data Product exploration page or in Excel after syncing. First PowerBI requires the DataOS user ID and API key for authentication, ensuring the user can access the full model except for any columns restricted by their data policies. This maintains security and ensures users only see the data they are authorized to view.
