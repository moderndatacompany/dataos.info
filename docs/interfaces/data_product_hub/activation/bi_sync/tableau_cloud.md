</center>

**Connection details**

- **Project**: Enter the Tableau project name. If left blank, the project name will default to the Data Product Name, registering all data sources under this project. Providing a custom project name enhances organization within Tableau.
- **Server Address**: The address of the Tableau server (e.g., `https://prod-apnortheast-a.online.tableau.com`).
- **Site ID**: The site ID (e.g., `tableausuer@123`).
- **Username**: The Tableau username.
- **Password**: The password associated with the Tableau account.

These details can be obtained upon logging into Tableau. The URL format will appear as follows:

[https://prod-apnortheast-a.online.tableau.com/#/site/site_id](https://prod-apnortheast-a.online.tableau.com/#/site/piyushjoshi704a51af6e)

**Sample URL**: 

[https://prod-apnortheast-a.online.tableau.com/#/site/tableauuser@123/home](https://prod-apnortheast-a.online.tableau.com/#/site/foxofe1086a891fef336/home)

In this example, `tableauuser@123` represents the **site_id**.

### **Step 6: Activate the connection**

After entering the required credentials, click the **Activate Key** button to establish the connection. A confirmation message will appear upon successful connection, as illustrated in the image below.

## Important Considerations for Tableau Integration

**1. Handling Entities without Relationships:** An error will occur during synchronization if any entity in the data model lacks a defined relationship. To resolve this issue, the entity can be hidden to avoid synchronization errors.

**2. Live connection:** The connection between the Lens semantic layer and Tableau Cloud is live. This means that any changes to the underlying data or measure logic will automatically be reflected in Tableau.

**3. Schema changes:** If there are schema updates, such as adding new dimensions or measures, the integration steps will need to be repeated to incorporate these changes into Tableau.

**4. Avoiding cyclic dependencies:** Tableau does not support cyclic dependencies within data models. To prevent integration issues, it is essential to ensure that the data model is free of cyclic dependencies prior to syncing with Tableau.


## Handling specific data types in Tableau

1. **Time data type as measure in Tableau**  

    When syncing the Lens semantic layer with Tableau, note that Tableau does not support the time data type as a measure. While Lens allows time-based measures, Tableau defaults to treating date and time fields as dimensions.As a result, Tableau will not correctly interpret any measure with a **time data type**.


    **Recommended actions**:

    To avoid synchronization issues:

    - Use time or date fields in Tableau only for **dimension-based** filtering or grouping.
    - For time-based calculations, limit aggregations to **MIN()** or **MAX()** functions.

2. **String data type to geographical**

    When connecting a dataset to Tableau, it automatically detects fields such as **City** and **Country** and converts them from string data types to **Geography** types. This enables Tableau to treat these fields as geographical locations, allowing features like map visualizations and geospatial analysis without the need for manual adjustments.

<aside class="callout">
ðŸ“Œ All limitations are specific to Tableau's handling of time data types as measures and does not affect other aspects of the Lens semantic layer's functionality.

## Data policies and security

Any data masking, restrictions, or permissions defined by the publisher will automatically be enforced for all viewers of the report, ensuring consistent data security and compliance. However, the behavior of data policies (e.g., masking) depends on who is the user of the PowerBI desktop.

## Error handling 

**Scenario 1: Handling syntactical errors in Measures or Dimensions** 

If a measure or dimension contains a syntactical error (and is also not functioning in Lens Studio), the following error will appear when attempting to select such a measure or dimension:

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="/resources/lens/bi_integration/image02.png" alt="Superset Configuration" style="max-width: 80%; height: auto; border: 1px solid #000;">
</div>

After correcting the syntactical error in the measure or dimension within Lens, the error will no longer appear. To reflect the changes in Tableau, refreshing the data source and re-selecting the measure or dimension will be necessary to display it in the chart.


<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="/resources/lens/bi_integration/image03.png" alt="Superset Configuration" style="max-width: 80%; height: auto; border: 1px solid #000;">
</div>


**Scenario 2: Reflecting logical changes in measures or dimensions**

If logical changes are made to a measure or dimension, for example adjusting how the sum is calculated, the changes will not be reflected in Tableau immediately.

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="/resources/lens/bi_integration/image04.png" alt="Superset Configuration" style="max-width: 80%; height: auto; border: 1px solid #000;">
</div>

Before the change, the sum calculation may appear as shown below:

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="/resources/lens/bi_integration/image05.png" alt="Superset Configuration" style="max-width: 80%; height: auto; border: 1px solid #000;">
</div>


**Scenario 3: Handling inactive Lens in the environment** 

If the Lens is not active in the environment while working on an existing workbook in Tableau or when attempting to establish a new connection, an error will be encountered. This may prevent access to or querying data from the Lens. Verification that the Lens exists and is active is required before syncing


**Scenario 4: Handling data source errors due to access restrictions**

If the Account table is set to public = false, a data source error will occur in Tableau. The error message will indicate that the "Account table not found," which will prevent querying or using data from that table.

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="/resources/lens/bi_integration/image06.png" alt="Superset Configuration" style="max-width: 80%; height: auto; border: 1px solid #000;">
</div>

To resolve this issue, ensure the Account table is accessible (set to public = true or assign appropriate permissions) and then resync the Lens in Tableau to regain access.

## Governance of model on Tableau Cloud

When the Lens Model is activated via BI Sync on Tableau, all user-level access controls and data policies from Lens are automatically applied to Tableau.

The management process involves authentication and authorization using the DataOS user ID and API key when accessing synced data models. This ensures that columns redacted by Lens data policies are restricted based on the user's group permissions.

For example, if a user named **iamgroot** in the "**Analyst**" group is restricted from viewing the "Annual Salary" column, this column will not be visible in either the Data Product exploration page or Tableau after syncing. Tableau Cloud requires the DataOS user ID and API key for authentication, ensuring that users can access the full model, except for any columns restricted by their data policies. This approach maintains security and guarantees that users only see the data they are authorized to view.
