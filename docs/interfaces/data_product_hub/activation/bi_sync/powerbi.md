# Integrate semantic model with Power BI Desktop

The following document outlines the process for integrating semantic model with Power BI Desktop.

The semantic model can be integrated with Power BI using the following ways:

- [Using Data Product Hub(Recommended - GUI based)](/interfaces/data_product_hub/activation/bi_sync/powerbi/#using-data-product-hub): Download `.pbip` file through an intuitive graphical interface.

- [Using cURL command (Command-Line based)](/interfaces/data_product_hub/activation/bi_sync/powerbi/#using-curl-command): Download `.pbip` Power BI connection via cURL command.

## Using Data Product Hub

### **Prerequisites**

- **Power BI Desktop version:** Use [Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/desktop) version `2.132.908.0` or later (version released after August 2024).

- **DataOS API Key:** Obtain your key from DPH Page > Profile Icon (bottom-left) > Name/Email > Tokens Tab.

    - If no API key is listed, click **`+Add API Key`**, provide a name for the token, and set an expiration duration (e.g., 24h or a specific date).

    - Once the key appears, click the eye icon to reveal it, then click the API key to copy.

Follow the below steps to integrate semantic model with Power BI using Data Product Hub:

### **Step 1: Navigate to the Data Product Hub**

Access the Home Page of DataOS. Click on Data Product Hub to explore the various Data Products available within the platform.

### **Step 2: Browse and select a Data Product**

Browse the list of Data Products and select a specific Data Product to initiate integration with Power BI. For instance 'Product Affinity'.

<img src="/resources/lens/bi_integration/powerbi(2).png" alt="DPH" style="width:40rem; border: 1px solid black;" />


### **Step 3: Access integration options**

Navigate to the Access options > BI Sync > Excel and Power BI. Click the Download `.pbip` file button to download the ZIP folder.

<img src="/resources/lens/bi_integration/powerbi(3).png" alt="DPH" style="width:40rem; border: 1px solid black;" />

### **Step 4: Download and open the ZIP file**

Access the downloaded ZIP file on the local system and extract its contents to the specified directory. The extracted folder will contain three files. Ensure all three files remain in the same directory to maintain semantic synchronization of the Data Product.

<img src="/resources/lens/bi_integration/extracted_files.png" alt="DPH" style="width:40rem; border: 1px solid black;" />

The folder contains the main components of a Power BI project for syncing the semantic model (hereÂ `productaffinity`). Here is the brief description of each:

- **public_productaffinity.Report:** This folder contains `definition.pbir` file related to the report definition in Power BI. It stores the report metadata such as the version and dataset reference in JSON format.

- **public_productaffinity.SemanticModel:** This folder contains files that define the underlying data model for Power BI project. The semantic model plays a crucial role in managing how Power BI interacts with data, setting up relationships, and measures.

    - **definition.bism:** Contains the overall definition of a semantic model and core settings. This file also specifies the supported semantic model definition formats through the 'version' property.

    - **model.bim:** The model.bim file is a JSON file that contains the Tabular Model Scripting Language (TMSL) definition of a Power BI semantic model. It's used to create a database from scratch by defining objects such as measures, tables, and connection sources.

- **public_productaffinity.pbip:** The `.pbip` file contains a pointer to a report folder, opening a `.pbip` opens the targeted report and model.

###  **Step 5: Enter credentials**

Open the `public_productaffinity` file in Power BI Desktop. A popup will appear prompting you to enter your 'DataOS username' and 'API key'.

<img src="/interfaces/data_product_hub/activation/bi_sync/powerbi/enter_username_and_apikey.png" alt="DPH" style="width:40rem; height:auto; border: 1px solid black;" />

After entering your credentials, click 'Connect'. A confirmation popup will appear; click 'OK' to proceed.

<img src="/interfaces/data_product_hub/activation/bi_sync/powerbi/popup_confirmation.png" alt="DPH" style="width:25rem; height:auto; border: 1px solid black;" />

### **Step 6: View data in Power BI**

Once connected, users can explore tables and views containing dimensions and measures to build and customize dashboards.

## Using cURL command

### **Prerequisites**

- **cURL**: Ensure you have `curl` installed on your system. Windows users may need to use `curl.exe`.

- **Power BI version:** Use `2.132.908.0` or later.

- **Lens API endpoint**: The API endpoint provided by Lens to sync semantic model, enabling integration with Power BI.

- **Power BI Desktop**: Ensure you have the Power BI Desktop app installed.

- **DataOS API key**: Ensure you have your DataOS API key. The API key can be obtained by executing the command below.

    ```bash
    dataos-ctl user apikey get
    ```

    If apikey is not listed already execute the below command to create one:

    ```bash
    dataos-ctl user apikey create #it will generate a apikey with default expiration time of 24h

    #or

    dataos-ctl user apikey create -n apikey_for_powerbi -d 48 h
    ```

### **cURL command**

Prepare the cURL command:

```bash
curl --location --request POST '${URL}' --header 'apikey: ${APIKEY}' --output ${FILE_NAME}.zip
```

**Parameters:**

1. **URL:**  This is the API endpoint for syncing semantic model with Power BI. It contains DATAOS FQDN, name and workspace of Lens (semantic model). 

    ```bash
    https://<DATAOS_FQDN>/lens2/sync/api/v1/power-bi/<workspace_name>:<lens_name> 
    ```

    - **DATAOS_FQDN:** Replace <DATAOS_FQDN> with the current Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) where the Lens is deployed. For example, `liberal-donkey.dataos.app`,. is the FQDN and `liberal donkey` is the context name.

    - **WORKSPACE_NAME:** Replace <workspace_name> with the actual workspace where Lens has been deployed. for e.g., `public`, `sandbox`, `curriculum`.

    - **LENS_NAME:** The name of the semantic model. For example `productaffinity`.


2. **Headers:**

    - **apikey:** User's API key for the current context in Lens.

    The DataOS API key for the user can be obtained by executing the command below.

    ```bash
    dataos-ctl user apikey get
    ```


3. **Output:** Replace `${File_name}` placeholder with the file name to save the file for example `file`. A `file.zip` archive is downloaded, containing the main components of a Power BI project. The name of the zip file can be specified during the curl command execution, and it will be saved accordingly. 

The `file.zip` includes essential components for syncing a semantic model with Power BI, organized into folders such as `.Report` and `.SemanticModel`.

- **public_productaffinity.Report:** This folder contains `definition.pbir` file related to the report definition in Power BI. It stores the report metadata such as the version and dataset reference in JSON format.

- **public_productaffinity.SemanticModel:** This folder contains files that define the underlying data model for Power BI project. The semantic model plays a crucial role in managing how Power BI interacts with data, setting up relationships, hierarchies, and measures.

    - **definition.bism:** Contains the overall definition of a semantic model and core settings. This file also specifies the supported semantic model definition formats through the 'version' property.

    - **model.bim:** The model.bim file is a JSON file that contains the Tabular Model Scripting Language (TMSL) definition of a Power BI semantic model. It's used to create a database from scratch by defining objects such as measures, tables, and connection sources.

- **public_productaffinity.pbip:** The `.pbip` file contains a pointer to a report folder, opening a `.pbip` opens the targeted report and model.

</div>

</aside>


### **Steps**

To begin syncing the semantic model, the following steps should be followed:

**Step 1: Run the curl command:** For example, if the Lens named `productaffinity` is located in the `public` workspace deployed on the `liberal-donkey` context, the curl command would be:

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'https://tcp.liberal-donkey.dataos.app/lens2/sync/api/v1/power-bi/public:productaffinity' --header 'apikey: abcdefgh==' --output file.zip 
```

**Step 2 Download the zip file:**  Once the command is executed, a zip file will be downloaded to the specified directory. The downloaded file should be unzipped. Three folders will be found inside, all of which are necessary for semantic synchronization with Power BI.

<img src="/resources/lens/bi_integration/extracted_files.png" alt="DPH" style="width:40rem; border: 1px solid black;" />

**Step 3 Open the Power BI file:** Open the Power BI file public_productaffinity using Power BI Desktop. Once opened, a prompt will appear asking for your credentials. Enter your DataOS username and API key to proceed.

## Supported data types

| **Category**   | **Data Types**                                                                  | **Support Status**                       |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Dimension**  | `time`, `string`, `number`, `boolean`                                                   | Supported                                |
| **Measure**    | `max`, `min`, `number`, `sum`, `count`, `boolean`, `string`, `time`, `avg`, `count_distinct`         | Supported                                |
| **Measure**    | `count_distinct_approx`                                                           | Not Supported                            |
| **Rolling Window** | -                                                                           | Not Supported (Power BI doesnât support) |

## Important considerations

- In Power BI, measures typically have an 'm_' prefix to indicate they represent a measure. For example, a measure calculating total revenue might be namedÂ `m_total_revenue`.
- The connection is live, meaning any changes to the underlying data will be reflected in Power BI.
- When schema changes occur, such as CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on dimensions, measures, or other elements of the semantic model, a re-sync is required. To prevent losing previously created reports after the re-sync, download the `.pbip` folder from the Data Product Hub, extract the contents, and replace the existing `.SemanticModel` folder with the new `.SemanticModel`.

## Best practices

Adhering to best practices ensures that you effectively utilize the Data Product Hub and maintain compatibility with the latest features and updates. Following these guidelines will help optimize workflow, enhance performance, and prevent potential issues.

### **File handling**

Ensure thatÂ `.pbip`Â folders are fully extracted before opening them. Failure to do so may result in missing file errors, as shown below:

<img src="/resources/lens/bi_integration/image.png" alt="DPH" style="width:15rem; border: 1px solid black;" />

### **Data retrieval and field selection considerations**

It is important to select fields from tables that are directly related or logically joined, as the system does not automatically identify relationships between tables through transitive joins. Selecting fields from unrelated tables may result in incorrect or incomplete results.

## Troubleshooting

### **Connection reset**

If you encounter a 'connection reset' error during Power BI sync as shown below:

<img src="/interfaces/data_product_hub/activation/bi_sync/powerbi/connection_reset.png" alt="DPH" style="width:25rem; border: 1px solid black;" />

- Go to the Home tab in Power BI Desktop.
- Click the Refresh button in the Queries section.

<img src="/interfaces/data_product_hub/activation/bi_sync/powerbi/refresh_key.png" alt="DPH" style="width:25rem; border: 1px solid black;" />

This should resolve the error and restore the sync.

### **Unknown cluster**

Whenever you encounter the error 'unknown cluster: <cluster_name>' as shown below, please check if the cluster has been deleted. If it has, redeploy the cluster. After redeploying the cluster, go to Power BI Desktop and click the 'Refresh' button to update the connection.

<!-- ### **Catalog not found** -->


## Limitations

- Power BI fails to handle special characters (e.g.,  &, %, #) when generating queries through the synced semantic model, causing errors in visualizations. Thus, it is best practice to address or remove special characters directly in the data.
- Power BI's Direct Query mode does not support creating custom dimensions and measures or querying the rolling window measure due to the lack of date hierarchy.
- DAX functions and Import query mode are not supported.


## Governance of semantic model

Data masking, restrictions, and permissions established by the publisher are automatically enforced for all report viewers, ensuring consistent data security and compliance. The behavior of these data policies, such as masking, may vary based on the use of Power BI Desktop or other interfaces.

When the Lens semantic model is activated via BI Sync on Power BI, authentication and authorization are handled using the DataOS user ID and API key. This ensures that columns redacted by Lens data policies are restricted based on the user's group permissions.

For example, if a user named iamgroot, belonging to the 'Analyst' group, is restricted from viewing the 'Annual Salary' column, this column will not appear in either the Data Product exploration page or in Power BI after synchronization. Power BI requires the DataOS user ID and API key for authentication, ensuring that users can access the full model except for columns restricted by their data policies.

This approach ensures that users only see the data they are authorized to view, maintaining security and compliance.

## FAQs

**1. What are the version compatibility requirements for Power BI Desktop integration?**

Power BI Desktop version 2.132.908.0 (released in August 2024) or later must be used for .pbip support without requiring preview settings. Additionally, Microsoft Power BI is primarily designed to run on Windows operating systems.

**2. How do you get started with the Power BI Desktop?**

To begin using Power BI Desktop:

- Download the Power BI ZIP folder from Data Product Hub (DPH) and extract it.

- Open the .pbip file from the extracted folder using the Power BI Desktop application.

- When prompted, provide your DataOS username and API token to connect to the data source.

- After successful authentication, you can start querying the semantic model and building reports.

**3. How does governance work in Power BI Desktop?**

**Access Management (User Permissions)**

Power BI Desktop users must provide their DataOS credentials (username and API token) when connecting to data sources. Upon successful authentication, they can begin developing reports within the Desktop environment.

**Data Governance (Row-Level, Column-Level Policies)**
Data policies such as redaction and access control are enforced based on the identity of the user who registered the data source. These policies govern access at both the row and column levels.

**4. What different data types are supported?**

**Supported Data Types**

| Category | Data Type | Support Status | Workaround |
|----------|-----------|----------------|------------|
| Dimension | Time, String, Number, Boolean | Supported | N/A |
| Measure | Max, Min, Number, Sum, Count, Boolean, String, Time, Avg, Count_distinct | Supported | N/A |
| Measure | Count_distinct_approx | Not Supported (Known Issue) | N/A |
| Rolling Window | - | Not Supported (Power BI does not support) | - |


**Limitations**

Due to limitations in Power BIâs DirectQuery mode, rolling window measures cannot be queried. This is because DirectQuery does not support date hierarchies, making it impossible to offer time-based granularity required for rolling window logic.

**Points to Note**

When creating cross-table queries, always select fields from logically related tables. Transitive joins are not auto-recognized by Power BI, and querying unrelated tables can yield incorrect results.

**5. How does model update work?**

If there are any schema changes in the semantic model, the model must be re-synced with Power BI. Re-downloading the Power BI project folder and opening the .pbip file without proper steps can cause previously created reports to be lost.

To safely update the model without losing existing reports:

- Download the new semantic model from Data Product Hub.

- Replace only the model.bim file in your current Power BI projectâs SemanticModel folder with the updated model.bim from the newly downloaded folder.

**6. Where does semantic modeling occur, and how does semantic model syncing to Power BI in DataOS differ from other use cases?**

**Semantic Model in BI Tools**

Semantic models built within BI tools like Power BI or Tableau allow for agile, team-specific dashboarding and metric development. However, this results in inconsistent definitions, semantic sprawl, and reduced trust as organizations scale.

**Best suited for:**

Teams engaged in frequent ad-hoc analysis and non-centralized metric definition.

**Limitations:**

- Duplicate modeling across teams.

- Platform-specific metric definitions.

- Proficiency in DAX and Power Query required.

- No native versioning support.

**Universal Semantic Layer**

Acts as a central bridge between raw data (e.g., warehouses or lakehouses) and analytics consumers. It standardizes metric and dimension definitions across tools, fostering trust and reuse.

**Best suited for:**

Organizations prioritizing governance and consistent analytics definitions.

**Limitations:**

- All logic must be defined in Lens.

- Custom dimensions and measures cannot be created in Power BI directly.

- Lens modeling expertise is necessary.

**Modeling at the Warehouse/Lakehouse Level**

Semantic logic is embedded within transformation pipelines, producing physically modeled data for specific use cases. However, this leads to redundancy and higher maintenance.

**Best suited for:**

- High-volume processing and complex transformation needs.

- Modifications often require table recreations.

- Increased data sprawl and complexity.

**7. How does Power BI sync work when syncing model-first data products?**

- The Power BI Developer downloads the project folder containing the semantic model and .pbip file.

- The .pbip file is launched in Power BI Desktop.

- Authentication is performed using DataOS credentials (User ID and API Token) via DirectQuery on port 6432.

- Queries triggered in Power BI are routed through the Postern service to the PgSQL API layer.

- The API forwards the request to Lens, which translates it into native SQL and queries the data source.

- The response flows back to Power BI Desktop for visual creation.

**8. What connection mode does Power BI use to connect to DataOS when working with a model-first data product?**

Power BI connects to DataOS using DirectQuery mode via the Postern service. When a visual is created, Power BI directly queries the underlying data source, and visual refresh time depends on source performance.

**9. Where does the computation happen for the Power BI semantic model sync?**

Computation occurs in two layers:

- Within DataOS: Lens translates semantic model queries into native SQL.

- Within Data Source: Actual data retrieval and computation are performed.

**10. What data sources are supported to sync model-first data products to Power BI?**

All data sources compatible with Lens can be synced to Power BI. The full list is available [here](/interfaces/data_product_hub/activation/bi_sync/powerbi/powerbi_service/#data-sources-supported-for-model-first-data-products).

<!-- For direct connection:

**Integrating DataOS Lakehouse with Power BI Via DataOS REST API Connector**

- Install the custom connector and visualize catalog tables in Power BI. Data is retrieved via the Minerva cluster. Installation guide [here](/interfaces/data_product_hub/activation/bi_sync/powerbi/powerbi_service/#integrating-dataos-lakehouse-with-power-bi-via-dataos-rest-api-connector).

- Via Presto ODBC Driver (requires paid license) -->


**11. Is custom measure and dimension creation supported for model-first data products in Power BI?**

No. All measures and dimensions must be defined in Lens. Power BI does not support custom calculation creation when using model-first products. For flexible use cases, integration with the Lakehouse is recommended. More info.

**12. What are the known limitations when syncing model-first data products to Power BI?**

- **Direct Publishing:** Not supported. Manual download and update are required for model changes.

- **On-Premises Gateway Dependency:**

    - Required to connect PostgreSQL-based semantic models.

    - Must configure gateway with Npgsql driver.

- **Special Characters:** Limited support in Power BI. Such characters must be handled in raw data or during semantic modeling.

**13. How can percentage formatting be enforced in Power BI visuals?**

Power BI allows format enforcement through its UI.

- **For Columns:** Select the column, go to Column Tools â Formatting â Set to "Percentage".

- **For Measures:** Select the measure, go to Measure Tools â Formatting â Choose "Percentage".


**14. How is dashboard data freshness maintained in Power BI using DirectQuery?**

DirectQuery ensures real-time querying from the data source, requiring no scheduled refresh. However, to ensure uninterrupted access, source-level monitoring of pipelines or jobs should be configured.
