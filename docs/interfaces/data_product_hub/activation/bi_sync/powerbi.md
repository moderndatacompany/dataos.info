# Integrate semantic model with Power BI Desktop

The following document outlines the process for integrating semantic model with Power BI Desktop.

The semantic model can be integrated with Power BI using the following ways:

- [Using Data Product Hub(Recommended - GUI based)](/resources/lens/bi_integration/#using-data-product-hub): Download `.pbip` file through an intuitive graphical interface.

- [Using cURL command (Command-Line based)](/resources/lens/bi_integration/#using-curl-command): Download `.pbip` Power BI connection via cURL command.

## Using Data Product Hub

### **Prerequisites**

- **Power BI Desktop version:** Use [Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/desktop) version `2.132.908.0` or later (version released after June 15, 2023).

- **DataOS API Key:** Obtain your key from DPH Page > Profile Icon (bottom-left) > Name/Email > Tokens Tab.

    - If no API key is listed, click **`+Add API Key`**, provide a name for the token, and set an expiration duration (e.g., 24h or a specific date).

    - Once the key appears, click the eye icon to reveal it, then click the API key to copy.

Follow the below steps to integrate semantic model with Power BI using Data Product Hub:

### **Step 1: Navigate to the Data Product Hub**

Access the Home Page of DataOS. Click on Data Product Hub to explore the various Data Products available within the platform.

### **Step 2: Browse and select a Data Product**

Browse the list of Data Products and select a specific Data Product to initiate integration with Power BI. For instance 'Product Affinity'.

<img src="/resources/lens/bi_integration/powerbi(2).png" alt="DPH" style="width:40rem; border: 1px solid black;" />


### **Step 3: Access integration options**

Navigate to the Access options > BI Sync > Excel and Power BI. Click the Download `.pbip` file button to download the ZIP folder.

<img src="/resources/lens/bi_integration/powerbi(3).png" alt="DPH" style="width:40rem; border: 1px solid black;" />

### **Step 4: Download and open the ZIP file**

Access the downloaded ZIP file on the local system and extract its contents to the specified directory. The extracted folder will contain three files. Ensure all three files remain in the same directory to maintain semantic synchronization of the Data Product.

<img src="/resources/lens/bi_integration/extracted_files.png" alt="DPH" style="width:40rem; border: 1px solid black;" />

The folder contains the main components of a Power BI project for syncing the semantic model (hereÂ `productaffinity`). Here is the brief description of each:

- **public_productaffinity.Report:** This folder contains `definition.pbir` file related to the report definition in Power BI. It stores the report metadata such as the version and dataset reference in JSON format.

- **public_productaffinity.SemanticModel:** This folder contains files that define the underlying data model for Power BI project. The semantic model plays a crucial role in managing how Power BI interacts with data, setting up relationships, and measures.

    - **definition.bism:** Contains the overall definition of a semantic model and core settings. This file also specifies the supported semantic model definition formats through the 'version' property.

    - **model.bim:** The model.bim file is a JSON file that contains the Tabular Model Scripting Language (TMSL) definition of a Power BI semantic model. It's used to create a database from scratch by defining objects such as measures, tables, and connection sources.

- **public_productaffinity.pbip:** The `.pbip` file contains a pointer to a report folder, opening a `.pbip` opens the targeted report and model.

###  **Step 5: Enter credentials**

Open the `public_productaffinity` file in Power BI Desktop. A popup will appear prompting you to enter your 'DataOS username' and 'API key'.

<img src="/interfaces/data_product_hub/activation/bi_sync/powerbi/enter_username_and_apikey.png" alt="DPH" style="width:40rem; height:auto; border: 1px solid black;" />

After entering your credentials, click 'Connect'. A confirmation popup will appear; click 'OK' to proceed.

<img src="/interfaces/data_product_hub/activation/bi_sync/powerbi/popup_confirmation.png" alt="DPH" style="width:25rem; height:auto; border: 1px solid black;" />

### **Step 6: View data in Power BI**

Once connected, users can explore tables and views containing dimensions and measures to build and customize dashboards.

## Using cURL command

### **Prerequisites**

- **cURL**: Ensure you have `curl` installed on your system. Windows users may need to use `curl.exe`.

- **Power BI version:** Use `2.132.908.0` or later.

- **Lens API endpoint**: The API endpoint provided by Lens to sync semantic model, enabling integration with Power BI.

- **Power BI Desktop**: Ensure you have the Power BI Desktop app installed.

- **DataOS API key**: Ensure you have your DataOS API key. The API key can be obtained by executing the command below.

    ```bash
    dataos-ctl user apikey get
    ```

    If apikey is not listed already execute the below command to create one:

    ```bash
    dataos-ctl user apikey create #it will generate a apikey with default expiration time of 24h

    #or

    dataos-ctl user apikey create -n apikey_for_powerbi -d 48 h
    ```

### **cURL command**

Prepare the cURL command:

```bash
curl --location --request POST '${URL}' --header 'apikey: ${APIKEY}' --output ${FILE_NAME}.zip
```

**Parameters:**

1. **URL:**  This is the API endpoint for syncing semantic model with Power BI. It contains DATAOS FQDN, name and workspace of Lens (semantic model). 

    ```bash
    https://<DATAOS_FQDN>/lens2/sync/api/v1/power-bi/<workspace_name>:<lens_name> 
    ```

    - **DATAOS_FQDN:** Replace <DATAOS_FQDN> with the current Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) where the Lens is deployed. For example, `liberal-donkey.dataos.app`,. is the FQDN and `liberal donkey` is the context name.

    - **WORKSPACE_NAME:** Replace <workspace_name> with the actual workspace where Lens has been deployed. for e.g., `public`, `sandbox`, `curriculum`.

    - **LENS_NAME:** The name of the semantic model. For example `productaffinity`.


2. **Headers:**

    - **apikey:** User's API key for the current context in Lens.

    The DataOS API key for the user can be obtained by executing the command below.

    ```bash
    dataos-ctl user apikey get
    ```


3. **Output:** Replace `${File_name}` placeholder with the file name to save the file for example `file`. A `file.zip` archive is downloaded, containing the main components of a Power BI project. The name of the zip file can be specified during the curl command execution, and it will be saved accordingly. 

The `file.zip` includes essential components for syncing a semantic model with Power BI, organized into folders such as `.Report` and `.SemanticModel`.

- **public_productaffinity.Report:** This folder contains `definition.pbir` file related to the report definition in Power BI. It stores the report metadata such as the version and dataset reference in JSON format.

- **public_productaffinity.SemanticModel:** This folder contains files that define the underlying data model for Power BI project. The semantic model plays a crucial role in managing how Power BI interacts with data, setting up relationships, hierarchies, and measures.

    - **definition.bism:** Contains the overall definition of a semantic model and core settings. This file also specifies the supported semantic model definition formats through the 'version' property.

    - **model.bim:** The model.bim file is a JSON file that contains the Tabular Model Scripting Language (TMSL) definition of a Power BI semantic model. It's used to create a database from scratch by defining objects such as measures, tables, and connection sources.

- **public_productaffinity.pbip:** The `.pbip` file contains a pointer to a report folder, opening a `.pbip` opens the targeted report and model.

### **Steps**

To begin syncing the semantic model, the following steps should be followed:

**Step 1: Run the curl command:** For example, if the Lens named `productaffinity` is located in the `public` workspace deployed on the `liberal-donkey` context, the curl command would be:

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'https://tcp.liberal-donkey.dataos.app/lens2/sync/api/v1/power-bi/public:productaffinity' --header 'apikey: abcdefgh==' --output file.zip 
```

**Step 2 Download the zip file:**  Once the command is executed, a zip file will be downloaded to the specified directory. The downloaded file should be unzipped. Three folders will be found inside, all of which are necessary for semantic synchronization with Power BI.

<img src="/resources/lens/bi_integration/extracted_files.png" alt="DPH" style="width:40rem; border: 1px solid black;" />

**Step 3 Open the Power BI file:** Open the Power BI file public_productaffinity using Power BI Desktop. Once opened, a prompt will appear asking for your credentials. Enter your DataOS username and API key to proceed.

## Supported data types

| **Category**   | **Data Types**                                                                  | **Support Status**                       |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Dimension**  | `time`, `string`, `number`, `boolean`                                                   | Supported                                |
| **Measure**    | `max`, `min`, `number`, `sum`, `count`, `boolean`, `string`, `time`, `avg`, `count_distinct`         | Supported                                |
| **Measure**    | `count_distinct_approx`                                                           | Not Supported                            |
| **Rolling Window** | -                                                                           | Not Supported (Power BI doesnât support) |

## Important considerations

- In Power BI, measures typically have an 'm_' prefix to indicate they represent a measure. For example, a measure calculating total revenue might be namedÂ `m_total_revenue`.
- The connection is live, meaning any changes to the underlying data will be reflected in Power BI.
- When schema changes occur, such as CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on dimensions, measures, or other elements of the semantic model, a re-sync is required. To prevent losing previously created reports after the re-sync, download the `.pbip` folder from the Data Product Hub, extract the contents, and replace the existing `.SemanticModel` folder with the new `.SemanticModel`.

## Best practices

Adhering to best practices ensures that you effectively utilize the Data Product Hub and maintain compatibility with the latest features and updates. Following these guidelines will help optimize workflow, enhance performance, and prevent potential issues.

### **File handling**

Ensure thatÂ `.pbip`Â folders are fully extracted before opening them. Failure to do so may result in missing file errors, as shown below:

<img src="/resources/lens/bi_integration/image.png" alt="DPH" style="width:15rem; border: 1px solid black;" />

### **Data retrieval and field selection considerations**

It is important to select fields from tables that are directly related or logically joined, as the system does not automatically identify relationships between tables through transitive joins. Selecting fields from unrelated tables may result in incorrect or incomplete results.

## Troubleshooting

### **Connection reset**

If you encounter a 'connection reset' error during Power BI sync as shown below:

<img src="/interfaces/data_product_hub/activation/bi_sync/powerbi/connection_reset.png" alt="DPH" style="width:25rem; border: 1px solid black;" />

- Go to the Home tab in Power BI Desktop.
- Click the Refresh button in the Queries section.

<img src="/interfaces/data_product_hub/activation/bi_sync/powerbi/refresh_key.png" alt="DPH" style="width:25rem; border: 1px solid black;" />

This should resolve the error and restore the sync.

### **Unknown cluster**

Whenever you encounter the error 'unknown cluster: <cluster_name>' as shown below, please check if the cluster has been deleted. If it has, redeploy the cluster. After redeploying the cluster, go to Power BI Desktop and click the 'Refresh' button to update the connection.

<!-- ### **Catalog not found** -->


## Limitations

- Power BI fails to handle special characters (e.g.,  &, %, #) when generating queries through the synced semantic model, causing errors in visualizations. Thus, it is best practice to address or remove special characters directly in the data.
- Power BI's Direct Query mode does not support creating custom dimensions and measures or querying the rolling window measure due to the lack of date hierarchy.
- DAX functions and Import query mode are not supported.


## Governance of semantic model

Data masking, restrictions, and permissions established by the publisher are automatically enforced for all report viewers, ensuring consistent data security and compliance. The behavior of these data policies, such as masking, may vary based on the use of Power BI Desktop or other interfaces.

When the Lens semantic model is activated via BI Sync on Power BI, authentication and authorization are handled using the DataOS user ID and API key. This ensures that columns redacted by Lens data policies are restricted based on the user's group permissions.

For example, if a user named iamgroot, belonging to the 'Analyst' group, is restricted from viewing the 'Annual Salary' column, this column will not appear in either the Data Product exploration page or in Power BI after synchronization. Power BI requires the DataOS user ID and API key for authentication, ensuring that users can access the full model except for columns restricted by their data policies.

This approach ensures that users only see the data they are authorized to view, maintaining security and compliance.
