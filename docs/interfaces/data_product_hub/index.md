# Data Product Hub

Data Product Hub (DPH) is a Graphical User Interface within DataOS where data analysts, business analysts, data scientists, and data app developers can discover actionable [Data Products](/products/data_product/) and perspectives. These Data Products are meticulously curated to provide business value and serve as a robust foundation for executing various use cases. Key use cases include **Analytics, AI/ML, GenAI/LLM on structured enterprise data, and data sharing**.

In addition, the DPH offers access to **DataAPIs** built on top of the Data Product layer, enhancing the ability to integrate and utilize data seamlessly. This platform effectively bridges the gap between IT-managed data infrastructure and business teams, enabling consistent data access despite changes in the underlying data systems. By providing curated, trusted data in multiple formats, the DPH significantly accelerates **time-to-value** for new use cases, helping organizations reduce **data total cost of ownership (TCO)** and achieve **more efficient and streamlined workflows**.
