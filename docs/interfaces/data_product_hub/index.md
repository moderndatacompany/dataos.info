# :interfaces-dataproducthub: Data Product Hub

Data Product Hub (DPH) is a Graphical User Interface within DataOS where data analysts, business analysts, data scientists, and data app developers can discover actionable [Data Products](/products/data_product/) and perspectives. These Data Products are meticulously curated to provide business value and serve as a robust foundation for executing various use cases. Key use cases include **Analytics**, **AI/ML**, **GenAI/LLM on structured enterprise data**, and **data sharing**.

In addition, the DPH offers access to **DataAPIs** built on top of the Data Product layer, enhancing the ability to integrate and utilize data seamlessly. This platform effectively bridges the gap between IT-managed data infrastructure and business teams, enabling consistent data access despite changes in the underlying data systems. By providing curated, trusted data in multiple formats, the DPH significantly accelerates **time-to-value** for new use cases, helping organizations reduce **data total cost of ownership (TCO)** and achieve **more efficient and streamlined workflows**.

## Key Features

## Data Product Exploration

The **Explore** button on the Data Product Hub interface allows you to drill deeper into the details of a Data Product. It presents data in visual forms such as tables and charts, provides details on the data model, and allows you to query using GraphQL enabling you to analyze the data before consuming it via APIs or BI tools.
