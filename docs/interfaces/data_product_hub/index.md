# :interfaces-dataproducthub: Data Product Hub

The Data Product Hub is a Graphical User Interface within DataOS where actionable [Data Products](/products/data_product/), Metrics and Perspectives can be discovered by data analysts, business analysts, data scientists, and data app developers. These Data Products are curated to provide business value and serve as a foundation for executing various use cases. Key use cases include **Analytics**, **AI/ML**, **GenAI/LLM on structured enterprise data**, and **data sharing**.

In addition, access to [Data APIs](/resources/stacks/talos/), built on top of the Data Product layer is offered by the Data Product Hub, enhancing the ability to integrate and utilize data seamlessly. The platform bridges the gap between IT-managed data infrastructure and business teams, enabling consistent data access despite changes in the underlying data systems. By providing curated, trusted data in multiple formats, time-to-value for new use cases is significantly accelerated by the Data Product Hub, helping organizations reduce data total cost of ownership (TCO) and achieve more efficient and streamlined workflows. To understand the key concepts of Data Product Hub, refer to the following link: [Core Concepts](/interfaces/data_product_hub/core_concepts/).

## Data Product exploration

The Explore button on the Data Product Hub interface allows deeper exploration into the details of a Data Product. Data can be presented in visual forms such as tables and charts, details on the data model are provided, and queries can be executed using GraphQL, enabling analysis of the data before consumption via APIs or BI tools. For more information, check out the [Data Product Exploration](/interfaces/data_product_hub/exploration/).
