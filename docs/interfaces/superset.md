<figcaption align = "center">Superset Interface</figcaption>


<aside class="callout">
ðŸ—£ There are various methods to create dashboards in Superset. You can design the layout and add charts, create charts individually, compile them into a dashboard, or generate charts directly from queries. Adhering to best practices is essential for efficient dashboard creation in Superset.

## Steps to Create the Dashboard

Unlock the potential of your data with our step-by-step guide to building an impactful dashboard. Before we dive into the first step, envision the value your insights will bringâ€”turning raw information into strategic clarity. Letâ€™s embark on this journey of transforming data into informed decisions.

### **Adding the Database**

You can add the database of your preference or utilize existing databases available for query execution to create charts and dashboards.

Letâ€™s see how you can add a Database to Superset:-

1. Go to **Settings**, in the top right corner.
2. Click on **Database Connections**, an interface will open.
3. Click on the **+DATABASE** icon.
4. Now you can select the database you want to add, fill in the required credentials, and add the database.

Check out the list of Databases supported by Superset in DataOS, [here](../interfaces/superset/supported_databases.md).

<aside class="callout">
ðŸ—£ In the Superset environment, only Admins are responsible for setting up database connections. If data developers wish to access particular databases, they need to submit source requests and the necessary permissions will be granted accordingly.

</aside>

### **Navigating to SQL Lab**

When using the SQL Lab feature in Superset to create dashboards, it's best to start with exploring data, forming queries, and generating datasets. This systematic approach gives you a clear and structured foundation to build comprehensive dashboards. 

Selecting the SQL tab at the navigation bar and choosing the SQL Lab in Superset will redirect you to the query interface. Here, you can write your queries and explore your data with efficiency. Moreover, delve into metadata by selecting the database, followed by the schema, and then the specific table on the left panel. This step allows for a comprehensive examination of the columns present in the table, along with their respective data types.

### **Writing a query**

Now, on SQL Lab you can write a query to create charts by selecting the database, schema, and table on the left panel. For example:

```sql
SELECT `Store` AS `Store`,
       `Date` AS `Date`,
       `Weekly_Sales` AS `Weekly_Sales`,
       `Holiday_Flag` AS `Holiday_Flag`,
       `Temperature` AS `Temperature`,
       `Fuel_Price` AS `Fuel_Price`,
       `CPI` AS `CPI`,
       `Unemployment` AS `Unemployment`
FROM `bigquery`.`dbt_asolanki`.`new_table`
LIMIT 100
```

#### **Saving query results as a dataset**

Following successful query execution, you have the option to create a dataset by saving the query as a dataset under the "SAVE" option. This dataset can subsequently be utilized to generate visuals.

![Untitled](/interfaces/superset/Untitled%20(6).png)

After saving the dataset you will be redirected to an interface where you can create charts. By default, it will automatically create the table chart but you can always change it to the chart of your choice.

### **Creating a dataset from the interface**

As you have already seen how you can create the dataset from the query, you can also create the dataset without writing the query letâ€™s see how.

In the Datasets tab, select "+ DATASET". Choose the database, schema, and table, then click "CREATE DATASET AND CREATE CHARTS". You'll be redirected to an interface where you can create charts by selecting the dataset and the chart type. 

![Untitled](/interfaces/superset/Untitled%20(7).png)

<aside class="callout">
ðŸ—£ Creating datasets this way has limitations compared to creating them via query. With queries, you can efficiently select all necessary data at once and apply filtration and transformation as needed, offering greater flexibility and efficiency in dataset creation.

</aside>

### **Creating charts**

Upon creating the dataset through query or interface, you will be redirected to the interface where chart creation occurs. Additionally, another method to create charts is by navigating to the Charts tab, selecting "+ CHART", choosing the dataset and chart type, and finally clicking "CREATE CHART", you can always change the chart type later.

After creating the chart via query you will be redirected to the following interface:

![Untitled](/interfaces/superset/Untitled%20(8).png)

Now, you can choose the desired chart type and efficiently drag and drop columns into the required fields. Subsequently, update the chart to reflect your desired configuration. Ensure to give your chart a meaningful name and save it.

Navigate to the dashboard tab and select "+ DASHBOARD". An interface for creating dashboards will open, allowing you to add charts to your dashboard. While you have the option to create charts within the dashboard interface, it is advisable to create your charts beforehand for best practice. Now you can drag and drop your charts into the dashboard with ease.R
