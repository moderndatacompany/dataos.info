## Views in Lens

Views act as an abstraction layer over the data graph of tables, allowing consumers to interact with a simplified version of the data model. They provide a streamlined interface for defining metrics, enabling end-users to focus on key metrics rather than the entire data model. Views reference dimensions, measures, and segments from multiple logical tables but do not contain their own measures, dimensions, or segments.

## When to define Views?

* **Defining Metrics**: Views allow you to define metrics by including measures and dimensions from different tables. This enables you to create denormalized tables that comprehensively address a specific use case. For instance, you can have a view that gives you all the dimensions and measures to understand ‘Weekly Spirits Sales in Florida’.

* **Providing a simplified interface**: By exposing only the relevant measures and dimensions, views make it easier for users to understand and query the data, reducing the complexity of the underlying data model.

## Types of Views



* **Entity-first:** An Entity-first view is structured around an real-world entity in your data model or object of interest, such as a `customer`, `product`, or `transaction`. In this type of view, the focus is on describing all the attributes and relationships of a single entity. The goal is to allow users to explore and analyze the characteristics and behaviors of these entities without necessarily being focused on metrics or aggregated measures. For example, an Entity-first view could include detailed customer profiles, product details, or individual transaction records.

* **Metric-first:** A Metric is a type of logical view that, by default, provides a logical view of a logical table, containing only one measure and a time dimension. This means that a Metric represents a specific data point or calculation over time, focusing on one key measure, such as average spent per category, retention rate, or churn rate, and linking it to a time period for analysis.

## How to define Views?

When designing how your semantic layer will be exposed and consumed by end users, you can follow either an **entity-first approach** or a **metrics-first approach.** In both cases, views will be used to build the semantic layer interface.

### **Entity-first approach**

In an entity-first approach, views are built around entities in your data model. Views are built as denormalized tables, bringing measures and dimensions from different tables needed to describe the entity fully.

In the example below, we create the `customer_churn_prediction` to describe the `customer`,  entity. It has multiple measures and dimensions from multiple logical tables such as `marketing_campaign`, `purchase_data`.

```yaml
views:
   - name: customer_churn_prediction
     description: It is containing the customer churn information.
     public: true
     meta:
       export_to_iris: true
     tables:
       - join_path: marketing_campaign
         prefix: true
         includes:
           - engagement_with_campaign1
           - acceptedcmp1
           - customer_id
           - engagement_score

       - join_path: customer
         prefix: true
         includes:
           - country
           - customer_segments

       - join_path: purchase_data
         prefix: true
         includes:
           - purchase_date  
           - recency
           - frequency
           - churn_probability_score
           - churn_rate
           - purchases

```

### **Metrics-first approach**

The **metrics-first approach** builds views around key performance metrics in a data model. Each view focuses on a specific measure and includes all relevant dimensions for grouping, filtering, and tracking time. This approach helps business teams make informed, data-driven decisions by providing clear, consistent, actionable metrics.

**Key benefits of the Metrics-first approach**

* **Operational evaluation**: Empowers users to understand key business performance metrics, enabling them to answer critical questions such as:

  * What happened?

  * Why did it happen?

  * What will happen next?

  * What should we do in response?

* **Simplified analysis**: By focusing on a single measure, each view allows for efficient and straightforward analysis, ensuring clarity in data interpretation.

* **Consistency**: Each metric is centrally defined, ensuring consistency across various tools and reports, thus eliminating discrepancies in business performance analysis.

A metric in the metrics-first approach typically includes:

* **Metric name**: A clear, descriptive name that reflects the purpose of the metric.

* **Measure**: The key performance indicator or value being tracked (e.g., customer churn rate).

* **Time dimension**: The period over which the metric is measured (e.g., daily, weekly). To access the time granularity feature, you must mention the timestamp data type instead of the time and date data type.

* **Related dimensions**: Additional attributes or dimensions (such as customer demographics, region, or product type) that allow for further breakdown and analysis.

Views are named after the specific metric they represent, making them easy to identify and work within various systems.

  ```yaml Syntax
  views:
    - name: {metric_name}
      description: {Description_of_the metric}
      public: {true}
      meta:
        title: {title_name_of_the_metric}
        tags:   
          - DPDomain.{Domain_name}
          - DPUsecase.{Use_case}
          - DPTier.{Tier}
        metric:
          expression: {"*/45  * * * *"}
          timezone: {"UTC"}
          window: {"day"}
          excludes: 
          - {purchases}
      tables:
        - join_path: {Tablename}
          prefix: {true}
          includes:
            - {metric}
            - {dimension that is used to calculate measure}
            - {time dimension}  #timestamp datatype
            - {another dimension to drill down}
            
  ```

  ```yaml Example
  #example 1 (single metric)
  views:
    - name: cloud_service_cost
      description: This metric tracks the total costs associated with cloud services, providing insights into resource usage, billing trends, and cost optimization opportunities. It helps organizations manage cloud expenditures and improve financial efficiency.
      public: true
      meta:
        metric:
          expression: "*/5  * * * *"
          timezone: "UTC"
          window: "week" #day, month, quarter, year
      tables:
        - join_path: billing
          prefix: true
          includes:
            - cost_by_cloud_service
            - billing_date
  ```
</CodeGroup>



If needed, you can create multiple views for different use cases from a single entity. This approach prevents users from being overwhelmed with too much data by presenting focused data slices in separate views, each highlighting only relevant measures and dimensions.

**Multiple metrics in the single view**

```yaml
#example 2 (multiple metrics in the same views YAML)
views:
  - name: conversion_rate
    description: This metric tracks the percentage of leads or prospects who successfully converted into paying customers over a month time period. It provides insights into the effectiveness of marketing efforts and sales processes.
    public: true
    meta:
      tags: 
        - DPDomain.Sales OPS
        - DPUsecase.Purchasing Behaviour Analysis
        - DPTier.Consumer Aligned
      metric:
        expression: "*/5  * * * *"
        timezone: "UTC"
        window: "month"
    tables:
      - join_path: sales
        prefix: true
        includes:
          - frequency
          - customer_no
          - invoice_date

  - name: qtd_revenue
    description: This metric tracks the total revenue generated in the current quarter to date (QTD). It provides insights into financial performance over the quarter, helping to evaluate growth trends and revenue targets.
    public: true
    meta:
      tags: 
        - DPDomain.Sales
        - DPUsecase.Purchasing Behaviour Analysis
        - DPTier.Consumer Aligned
      metric:
        expression: "*/5  * * * *"
        timezone: "UTC"
        window: "month"

    tables:
      - join_path: sales
        prefix: true
        includes:
          - total_revenue
          - invoice_date
          - source

      - join_path: product
        prefix: true
        includes:
          - category
          - brand
          - class

      - join_path: account
        prefix: true
        includes:
          - site_name
          - state
          - license_type
          - customer_name
```

## Best practice

* **If a metric is relevant across multiple time dimensions**, consider creating separate views for each time period (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly). This approach ensures better compatibility with BI tools and enhances clarity for users by offering distinct, time-based views of the same metric.

* **For use cases requiring focused data**, you can create multiple views based on a single entity. This prevents overwhelming users with excessive data and allows them to explore more targeted and relevant metrics by presenting them in separate views.

## **Exploration and activation**

* **Exploration**: Views can be explored using tools such as **Iris Board,** which provides automated, dynamic dashboards for visualizing and analyzing performance metrics. These tools help detect anomalies and reveal trends over time. You can also query the view in Lens Studio directly.

* **Activation**: Metrics can be embedded into operational workflows, triggering alerts, populating Excel models for cross-tab analysis, or integrated into email automation tools for marketing or retention strategies.

* You can explore the view via

  * Iris Board

  * Data Product Hub
