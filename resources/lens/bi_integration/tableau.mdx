üí° For a streamlined and user-friendly integration with Tableau, use the Data Product Hub interface. This approach eliminates the need for manually working with `curl` commands, providing an easy way to connect to your Lens semantic model.

To get started with Tableau integration through Data Product Hub, refer to the link below:

<a href="/interfaces/data_product_hub/activation/bi_sync/tableau_cloud/">Access the Tableau integration guide</a>.
</aside>

### **Prerequisites**

- **Curl**: Ensure that `curl` is installed on the system. For Windows systems, `curl.exe` may be necessary.
- **Lens API endpoint**: The API endpoint provided by Lens to sync semantic model, enabling integration with Tableau.
- **Access credentials**: Access credentials such as username, password, project name etc., are required for Tableau.
- **DataOS API key**: Ensure the DataOS API key is available. Get it by using the following command:

```bash
dataos-ctl user apikey get
```

### **Steps**

To sync the semantic model with Tableau, follow the steps below:

**Step 1: Run the curl command**

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'http://tcp.<DATAOS_FQDN>/lens2/sync/api/v1/tableau-cloud/<WORKSPACE_NAME>:<LENS_NAME>' \
--header 'apikey: <APIKEY>' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "project_name": "<SAMPLE>",
    "username": "{USER_NAME/EMAIL}",
    "password": "<PASSWORD>",
    "site_id": "<SITE_ID>",
    "server_address": "https://prod-apnortheast-a.online.tableau.com"
}'
```

1. **URL:**

    - This endpoint is used to sync a specific semantic model to Tableau for public access.
    - Replace `<DATAOS_FQDN>` with the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) where Lens is hosted. Example: liberal-monkey.dataos.app.
    - Replace `<WORKSPACE_NAME>` with the name of the workspace where the semantic model (Lens) is deployed. e.g., `public`, `curriculum`.
    - Replace `<LENS_NAME>` with the name of the semantic model to sync. e.g., `sales360`.

2. **Headers:**

    - **apikey:** User's API key for the current context in Lens. The DataOS API key for the user can be obtained by executing the below command.

        ```bash
        dataos-ctl user apikey get
        ```

    - **`Content-Type application/json`:** Specifies that the data being sent is in JSON format.
 
3. **Raw data payload:**

    This section defines the details of the user's Tableau credentials and project configuration:

    - **project_name:** The name of the Tableau project where the data will be synced. Replace `<sample>` with the actual project name. If the project does not already exist, Tableau will create a new project with the given name.

    - **username:** Tableau account username, typically the email ID used to log in to Tableau.

    - **password:** Tableau account password.
    
    - **site_id:** The site ID associated with the current Tableau connection.

    - **server_address:** The URL of the Tableau server.  Replace `<server_address>` with the correct server address (e.g., https://prod-apnortheast-a.online.tableau.com). This information can be obtained upon logging in to Tableau. The URL will appear as follows:

        > https://prod-apnortheast-a.online.tableau.com/#/site/iamgroot1086a891fef336/home

         Here: **iamgroot1086a891fef336**  is the **site_id**.

**Step 2: Go to Tableau:** Access the Explore tab on the left side. The required tables and views will be visible in the project. In the screenshot below, there are three sources: one for tables and two for views.

 <div>
    <img src="/resources/lens/bi_integration/tableau1.png" alt="Superset Configuration"  />
</div>

**Step 3: Explore and create visualizations** Navigate to the Home tab on the left side and click on 'New'. Under this option, select 'Workbook'.

 <div>
    <img src="/resources/lens/bi_integration/tableau2.png" alt="Superset Configuration"  />
</div>

**Step 4: Connect to data** After clicking on 'Workbook', the 'Connect to Data' page will be displayed. Select either views or tables and click on 'Connect'.

 <div>
    <img src="/resources/lens/bi_integration/tableau3.png" alt="Superset Configuration"  />
</div>

Upon clicking 'Connect', a prompt will request the username and password. Enter the DataOS username and API key.


 <div>
    <img src="/resources/lens/bi_integration/tableau4.png" alt="Superset Configuration"  />
</div>

**Step 5: Start using the semantic model** After entering the credentials and clicking on 'Sign In', the model will be ready for visualization purposes.

The publisher can embed their credentials (DataOS username and API Token) or ask users to provide credentials whenever they want to access the published Workbook/Sheet/Dashboard. If the publisher has chosen to ‚ÄòEmbed password for data source‚Äô, users can access the published workbook and dashboard without providing credentials.

Once the credentials are embedded, they cannot be accessed. You need to overwrite and ‚Äòpublish-as‚Äô the workbook to reconfigure the embedding password optionality.

## Important considerations for Tableau integration

**1. Handling Entities without Relationships:** An error will occur during synchronization if any entity in the data model lacks a defined relationship. To resolve this issue, the entity can be hidden to avoid synchronization errors.

**2. Live connection:** The connection between the Lens semantic layer and Tableau Cloud is live meaning that any changes to the underlying data will automatically be reflected in Tableau.

**3. Schema changes:** If there are schema updates, such as adding new dimensions or measures, the integration steps will need to be repeated to incorporate these changes into Tableau.

**4. Avoiding cyclic dependencies:** Tableau does not support cyclic dependencies within data models. To prevent integration issues, it is essential to ensure that the data model is free of cyclic dependencies prior to syncing with Tableau.

**5. Visualization with multiple data sources:** You cannot build a visualization that incorporates data from multiple data sources. For live connections, Tableau does not support data blending. Only a single data source can be used to create a visualization.

**6. Centralized management:** All data sources should be managed and published by the admin on the server, with everyone else using this source.

**7. Single authority for Desktop publications:** If data sources are published via Tableau Desktop, ensure that all sources are published by a single authority to avoid multiple data source conflicts on the server.

**8. Row limit:** The Lens API has a maximum return limit of 50,000 rows per request. To obtain additional data, it is necessary to set an offset. This row limit is in place to manage resources efficiently and ensure optimal performance.

**9. Selection:** It is important to select fields from tables that are directly related or logically joined, as the system does not automatically identify relationships between tables through transitive joins. Selecting fields from unrelated tables may result in incorrect or incomplete results.

**10. Parameter Action:** Action filters can be defined on measures/dimensions to filter visualizations effectively.

**11. Default chart types:** All default chart types provided by Tableau can be plotted and visualized without issues.

**12. Rolling Window Measure:** For querying a rolling window measure, it is necessary to provide a time dimension and apply a date range filter to this time dimension. When querying a rolling window measure, follow these steps:

- Select the rolling window measure.
- Select the time dimension.
- To define granularity, right-click on the selected time dimension and set granularity (choose a granularity where the complete time, along with the year, is shown).
- Add the time dimension to the filter, and define the range filter.

## Error handling 

**Scenario 1: Handling syntactical errors in measures or dimensions** 

If a measure or dimension contains a syntactical error (and is also not functioning in Explore studio of DPH), the following error will appear when attempting to select it:

 <div>
    <img src="/resources/lens/bi_integration/image02.png" alt="Superset Configuration" / >
</div>

After correcting the syntactical error in the measure or dimension within Lens, the error will no longer appear. To reflect the changes in Tableau, refreshing the data source and re-selecting the measure or dimension will be necessary to display it in the chart.


 <div>
    <img src="/resources/lens/bi_integration/image03.png" alt="Superset Configuration" / >
</div>

**Scenario 2: Handling inactive Lens in the environment** 

If the Lens is not active in the environment while working on an existing workbook in Tableau or when attempting to establish a new connection, an error will be encountered. This may prevent access to or querying data from the Lens. Verify that the Lens exists and is active before syncing.


**Scenario 3: Handling data source errors due to access restrictions**

If the Account table is set to `public = false`, a data source error will occur in Tableau. The error message will indicate that the 'Account table not found,' which will prevent querying or using data from that table.

 <div>
    <img src="/resources/lens/bi_integration/image06.png" alt="Superset Configuration" / >
</div>

To resolve this issue, ensure the Account table is accessible (set to `public = true` or assign appropriate permissions) and then resync the Lens in Tableau to regain access.


## Governance of model on Tableau Cloud

When the semantic model is activated via BI Sync in Tableau, data masking, restrictions, and permissions set by the publisher are automatically applied, ensuring consistent data security and compliance. The behavior of these policies (e.g., masking) may vary based on the Tableau user.

The Tableau management process involves authentication and authorization using the DataOS user ID and API key when accessing synced data models. This ensures that columns redacted by Lens data policies are restricted based on the user's group permissions.

For example, if a user named **iamgroot** in the **Analyst** group is restricted from viewing the 'Annual Salary' column, this column will not be visible in either the Data Product exploration page or Tableau after syncing. Tableau Cloud requires the DataOS user ID and API key for authentication, ensuring that users can access the full model, except for any columns restricted by any data policies. This approach maintains security and guarantees that users only see the data they are authorized to view.
