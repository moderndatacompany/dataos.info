## Controlling Access to Lens and its Semantic Model  


Data governance in DataOS is structured across three layers to protect and control sensitive information:

* **Physical data layer:** Governance policies are applied directly at the physical data layer, where the data resides in sources such as BigQuery, Postgres, Snowflake, or other data storage platforms. These policies enforce data protection at the source, controlling access and masking sensitive information before it is processed or exposed further. To know about how to govern the Lens click [here](/resources/lens/governance/).

* **Model-first Data Product layer:** At this layer, governance policies are applied to the semantic model (Lens) derived from the underlying source tables. To manage access effectively [user groups](/resources/lens/working_with_user_groups/) define different levels of exploration permissions within Lens.

* **Activation layer:** Governance at the activation layer focuses on enforcing data protection within the Business Intelligence (BI) tool. This ensures that sensitive data remains masked or restricted based on user roles when presented through dashboards or reports, controlling how the data is accessed and displayed in the final interface.


Permissions for reading, creating, updating, or deleting Lens and accessing its semantic model can be granted either by assigning a role or a use case.  

### Access via use-cases  

The following use cases are required:  

1. `Create, Update, and Delete Lens in a specified workspace within the user layer`.
2. `Read Lens2 backend`.  

### Access via Roles  

If access is granted through a role, it must include the necessary Lens-related use cases. For example, the **`Data-dev`** role contains permissions for creating and managing a Lens.  

The **`Data-dev`** role is identified by the tag `roles:id:data-dev`.  

<Note>  
The name and permission levels of roles and use cases may vary across organizations, depending on how they are managed.

## Granting a use-case to a user  

<Steps>  

  <Step title="Navigate to DataOS">  
    Log in to DataOS and open Bifrost. The Bifrost interface will launch.  

    ![](/resources/scanner/governance/bifrost.png)  
  </Step>  

  <Step title="Search for the User" titleSize="h2">  
    Navigate to the 'Users' tab and use the search box to locate the user.  

    ![](/resources/scanner/governance/bifrost_user_iamgroot.png)  
  </Step>  

  <Step title="Select the User" titleSize="h2">  
    After selecting the user, detailed information will be displayed. Go to the 'Grants' section to manage assigned permissions and use cases.  

    ![](/resources/scanner/governance/iamgroot_grants_tab.png)  

    Click on the 'Grant Use-Case' button.  
  </Step>  

  <Step title="Search for the Required Use Case" titleSize="h2">  
    A search dialog box will appear after clicking the 'Grant Use-Case' button. Search for the required use case:  

    **`Create, Update, and Delete Lens in user layer specified workspace â€“ Manage Lens in the specified workspace`**  

    ![](/resources/lens/governance/search_use_case.png)  
  </Step>  

  <Step title="Specify the Workspace" titleSize="h2">  
    After selecting the use case, a dialog box will prompt for the workspace name. Enter the workspace name where access should be granted.  

    <Note>  
      A workspace name must be specified for each action (Read, Create, Update, and Delete) to ensure precise permission assignment.  
    </Note>  

    In the example below, the user has been granted permission to read Lens in all workspaces but can create, update, and delete only in the `curriculum` workspace.  

    ![](/resources/lens/governance/use_case_dialog_box.png)  

    After completing the form, click `Grant`. The permissions will be updated, allowing the user to read Lens in all workspaces while managing Lens only in the `curriculum` workspace.  
  </Step>
