## Controlling Access to Lens and Its Semantic Model  

Permissions for reading, creating, updating, or deleting Lens and accessing its semantic model can be granted either by assigning a role or a use case.  

### Access via Use Cases  

The following use cases are required:  

1. `Create, Update, and Delete Lens in a specified workspace within the user layer`.
2. `Read Lens2 backend`.  

### Access via Roles  

If access is granted through a role, it must include the necessary Lens-related use cases. For example, the **`Data-dev`** role contains permissions for creating and managing a Lens.  

The **`Data-dev`** role is identified by the tag `roles:id:data-dev`.  

<Note>  
The name and permission levels of roles and use cases may vary across organizations, depending on how they are managed.

  <Step title="Search for the User" titleSize="h2">  
    Navigate to the 'Users' tab and use the search box to locate the user.  

    ![](/resources/scanner/governance/bifrost_user_iamgroot.png)  
  </Step>  

  <Step title="Select the User" titleSize="h2">  
    After selecting the user, detailed information will be displayed. Go to the 'Grants' section to manage assigned permissions and use cases.  

    ![](/resources/scanner/governance/iamgroot_grants_tab.png)  

    Click on the 'Grant Use-Case' button.  
  </Step>  

  <Step title="Search for the Required Use Case" titleSize="h2">  
    A search dialog box will appear after clicking the 'Grant Use-Case' button. Search for the required use case:  

    **`Create, Update, and Delete Lens in user layer specified workspace â€“ Manage Lens in the specified workspace`**  

    ![](/resources/lens/governance/search_use_case.png)  
  </Step>  

  <Step title="Specify the Workspace" titleSize="h2">  
    After selecting the use case, a dialog box will prompt for the workspace name. Enter the workspace name where access should be granted.  

    <Note>  
      A workspace name must be specified for each action (Read, Create, Update, and Delete) to ensure precise permission assignment.  
    </Note>  

    In the example below, the user has been granted permission to read Lens in all workspaces but can create, update, and delete only in the `curriculum` workspace.  

    ![](/resources/lens/governance/use_case_dialog_box.png)  

    After completing the form, click `Grant`. The permissions will be updated, allowing the user to read Lens in all workspaces while managing Lens only in the `curriculum` workspace.  
  </Step>
