The data model in Lens transforms raw data into meaningful business definitions, optimizing it for analytical purposes. This model is exposed through a robust set of APIs, enabling end-users to run diverse analytical queries without modifying the underlying data model. Let’s take a sales table as an example, containing the following columns:

### `sales `Table

| order\_id | product | amount | city          | customer\_name |
| --------- | ------- | ------ | ------------- | -------------- |
| 1         | Shoes   | 150    | New York      | John Doe       |
| 2         | Jacket  | 200    | San Francisco | Jane Smith     |
| 3         | Hat     | 50     | Los Angeles   | Michael Brown  |
| 4         | Shoes   | 120    | New York      | Emily Davis    |
| 5         | Jacket  | 220    | Chicago       | Sarah Wilson   |

To analyze sales data effectively, it is essential to address key business questions, such as:

* What is the total sales amount?

* How many orders were placed?

* What is the average sales amount?

* How do sales vary across different cities and customers?

Rather than crafting individual SQL queries for each question ,the Lens data model provides a robust framework for efficiently organizing and analyzing data to answer business questions. By modeling entities and their relationships, it allows for a structured approach to data analysis. For instance, Lens enables the modeling of entities like sales, orders, and products, ensuring their interactions are clearly defined.

To effectively leverage Lens for data modeling, several core concepts are crucial. These concepts help convert raw data into actionable business insights, facilitating the extraction of meaningful results. The following sections outline the foundational components of the Lens data modeling approach, designed to optimize your analytical workflows.

## Table

A table is a logical construct used to define an real-world entity such as `customer`, `product.` It contains information about joins (relationships), dimensions, measures, and segments. Each table is defined in a separate YAML file.

We'll use a sample database with two tables, `owner` and `contacts` to illustrate the concepts.

`owner` Table

| owner\_id | owner\_name    | owner\_email        | city          |
| --------- | -------------- | ------------------- | ------------- |
| 1         | Alice Johnson  | alice@example.com   | New York      |
| 2         | Bob Smith      | bob@example.com     | San Francisco |
| 3         | Charlie Brown  | charlie@example.com | Los Angeles   |
| 4         | David Williams | david@example.com   | Chicago       |
| 5         | Emma Davis     | emma@example.com    | Miami         |

`contacts` Table

| contact\_id | owner\_id | contact\_name | contact\_email         | phone\_number |
| ----------- | --------- | ------------- | ---------------------- | ------------- |
| 1           | 1         | John Doe      | john.doe@example.com   | 123-456-7890  |
| 2           | 2         | Jane Smith    | jane.smith@example.com | 987-654-3210  |
| 3           | 3         | Michael Brown | michael.b@example.com  | 555-123-4567  |
| 4           | 4         | Sarah Johnson | sarah.j@example.com    | 444-222-3333  |
| 5           | 5         | Robert Wilson | robert.w@example.com   | 777-888-9999  |

**Example**

In the example below the `owner` table is defined for a sales analytics Lens:

```yaml
tables:
  - name: owner
    sql: {{ load_sql('owner') }}
    description: Table containing information about the owners.
    data_source: icebase
    public: true   
```

You can also use the `tables` attribute to accommodate more complex SQL queries:

```yaml
tables:
  - name: owner
    sql: >
      SELECT *
      FROM owner_id, email
      WHERE owner.owner_id = contacts.owner_id
```

> Within each table, dimensions, measures, and segments are defined. Joins are used to define relations between tables.

**Attribute**

The table declaration involves the following attributes:

| **Property**  | **Description**                                                                                                                 | **Possible Value**                       | **Best Practice**                                                                                                                    |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `name`        | Specify the name of the table:<br />- Should start with a letter only<br />- Can only contain letters, numbers, and underscores | <code>^\[a-zA-Z]\[a-zA-Z0-9\_]\*$</code> | Use snake\_case. For example: `sales_insight`                                                                                        |
| `sql`         | Add a reference to the SQL file to map data to the table. SQL mapping is maintained in a separate file                          | NA                                       | Keep SQL clearly named for easy maintenance.                                                                                         |
| `description` | Description of the table's purpose                                                                                              | NA                                       | Provide a concise yet informative description to aid understanding                                                                   |
| `public`      | Controls visibility of the table, i.e., whether the table is visible to all users or hidden                                     | True, False                              | Use **`True`** for tables that should be widely accessible and **`False`** for those that are sensitive or irrelevant to most users​ |
| `joins`       | Define the relationship with other tables. Left joins are created. The table within which the join is defined is on the left.   | NA                                       | Use joins judiciously to avoid transitive join issues                                                                                |
| `dimensions`  | Dimensions associated with the table for slicing and dicing data                                                                | NA                                       | Define dimensions that are frequently used in filtering and grouping data​                                                           |
| `measures`    | Aggregation over a dimension                                                                                                    | NA                                       | Focus on measures that provide key business insights.                                                                                |
| `segments`    | An array of segments can be defined. Segments are to filter data based on specific criteria                                     | NA                                       | Create segments that represent filter groups used in common business queries to enhance usability​                                   |

## Joins

The join parameter can be used to define the relationship between two tables. Lens employs left join for all joins it generates. It's important to note that the table (referred to as the base table) in which the join is specified will always be positioned on the left side of the join.

There are three types of join relationships (one\_to\_one, one\_to\_many, and many\_to\_one) and a few other concepts.

**Attributes**

| **Property**   | **Description**                                                                         |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`         | Candidate target table for joining with the base table                                  |
| `relationship` | Type of join relationship with other tables - `one-to-one`, `one-to-many`,`many-to-one` |
| `sql`          | Join clause Syntax: base\_table.key = target\_table.key                                 |

**Example:**

In this example, we define the base table and outline its relationship with another table. Specifically, multiple transactions can reference the same product, establishing a `many-to-one` relationship between the transactions table and the products table. In this context, the placeholder {TABLE} refers to the base table, which is the transactions table.&#x20;

```yaml owner.yml
tables:
  - name: owner
    sql: {{ load_sql('owner') }}
    description: Table containing information about owner records.
    joins:
      - name: contacts
        relationship: one_to_many
        sql: "{TABLE.owner_id}= {contacts.owner_id}"   
```

## Dimensions

Dimensions represent the properties of a single data point in the table. They are descriptive attributes, often text values, that provide context to the data in a fact table. For example, in a sales database, attributes like `product_name`, `category`, and `region`, are called dimensions of that table which help to categorize and provide context for the `sales` table. The dimensions serve as the guidelines for data analysts to view the information from different angles and apply different filtering criteria.

For example, in the following YAML code snippet, the `owner` table is defined, with unique attributes such as `id` and `email` categorized as dimensions.

```yaml owner.yml
tables:

  - name: owner
    sql: {{ load_sql('owner') }}
    description: Table containing information about owner records.
    
    dimensions:
      - name: owner_id
        type: string
        description: Unique identifier for each owner.
        sql: owner_id
        primary_key: true
        public: true

      - name: email
        type: string
        description: Email address of the owner.
        sql: email
```

The dimension declaration involves the following properties:

| **Property**  | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                | **Possible Value**            | **Best Practice**                                                                                  |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`        | Unique identifier of the dimension                                                                                                                                             | ^\[a-zA-Z]\[a-zA-Z0-9\_]\*$   | Use snake\_case. <br /> For example: **`order_date`**                                              |
| `title`       | Human-readable title of the dimension. Use ‘title’ to change the display name                                                                                                  | String                        | Provide a clear and concise title for better readability and user understanding                    |
| `description` | Description of the dimension's purpose                                                                                                                                         | String                        | Provide a detailed description to explain the dimension's business value                           |
| `column`      | References the column defined in the table’s SQL. While custom SQL can be defined in a table’s dimension, best practice suggests that it should be defined in the table’s SQL. |                               |                                                                                                    |
| `public`      | Controls visibility of dimension, i.e. whether the dimension is visible to all users or hidden. If not mentioned explicitly, by default this property is true                  | True, False                   | Set to **`True`** for key dimensions that should be visible by default                             |
| `primary_key` | The key on which the join relationship will be defined                                                                                                                         | Column name                   | Ensure each dimension has a unique primary key to maintain data integrity                          |
| `type`        | The data type of the dimension                                                                                                                                                 | string, number, time, boolean | Choose the appropriate data type to ensure proper sorting and filtering​                           |
| `meta`        |  Ensures sensitive data is masked for specified user groups.                                                                                                                   | Key-value pairs               | Use metadata to provide additional context about the dimension, such as tags, or custom attributes |
| `sub_query`   | Sub-query for the dimension. Set the flag to reference a measure of one table in dimension of another                                                                          |                               | Use to define complex dimensions using sub-queries                                                 |

## Measures

Measures are quantifications, representing fields such as order subtotal, quantity of items purchased, or duration spent on a specific page. They encompass any measurable numerical value on which statistical calculations can be applied, including sum, average, and variance. For instance, with a measure like quantity of items purchased, operations can include calculating the average quantity ordered, sorting by descending quantities, summing all quantities, and performing various statistical analyses. For instance, consider the following YAML definition:

```yaml
tables:
  - name: sales
    sql: {{ load_sql('sales') }}
    description: Table containing sales records with order details.

    measures:
      - name: total_orders_count
        type: count
        sql: id
        description: Total amount of orders.
    #....
```

This snippet defines a table named `sales`, representing sales records with order details. Within the `measures` block, a measure called `total_orders_count` is created. This measure, of type `count`, uses the `id` column to calculate the total number of orders.

When this measure is requested via an API, Lens will generate and execute SQL similar to the following:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(order_id) AS total_orders_count
FROM sales;
```

When a `city` dimension is applied to the measure to answer the question *"Where are customers based?"*, Lens generates SQL with a `GROUP BY` clause, such as:

```sql
SELECT city, COUNT(id) AS count
FROM users
GROUP BY 2;
```

You can include multiple dimensions in your query to perform grouping as needed.

### **Calculated Measures**

To answer the question “What is the average sales amount per order?”, you’ll need to calculate the average amount for all orders. This can be done by defining a measure that calculates the average of the amount field. Here’s how you can define this in YAML for your sales table:

```yaml
measures:
 - name: total_sales_amount
   sql: SUM(amount)
   type: number
   description: Total sales amount across all orders.

 - name: total_order_count
   sql: COUNT(order_id)
   type: count
   description: Total number of orders.

 - name: average_sales_amount_per_order
   sql: "{total_sales_amount} / NULLIF({total_order_count}, 0)"
   type: number
   format: currency
   description: The average sales amount per order.

# .....
```

Here we defined a calculated measure `average_sales_amount_per_order`, which divides the total sales amount by the total number of orders. The NULLIF function prevents division by zero in case there are no orders.

This example shows how you can reference measures inside other measure definitions. When you request the `average_sales_amount_per_order` measure via an API, the following SQL will be generated:

```sql
SELECT
  SUM(amount) / NULLIF(COUNT(order_id), 0) AS average_sales_amount_per_order
FROM
  sales
```

As with other measures, average\_sales\_amount\_per\_order can be used with dimensions.

### **Measure Additivity**

Additivity is a property of measures that tells us if we can break down or combine measure values across different categories. In simpler terms, it means that if we have a measure for a group of dimensions (like sales for different regions), we can add or combine these values to get a measure for a smaller subset of those dimensions (like sales for a specific region).

Additivity of a measure depends on its type. Only measures with the following types are considered additive: count, count\_distinct\_approx, min, max, sum. Measures with all other types are considered non-additive.

The measure declaration involves the following properties:

| **Property**  | **Description**                      | **Possible Value**                                                                                                    | **Best Practice**                                                                                                                   | **Usage**                                                                                                                      |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `name`        | Unique identifier of the measure     | ^\[a-zA-Z]\[a-zA-Z0-9\_]\*$                                                                                           | Use snake\_case.

```yaml
tables:
  - name: owner
    sql: {{ load_sql('owner') }}
    description: Table containing information about owners.
    
    measures:
      - name: count
        sql: customer_id
        type: count_distinct
        description: Total number of owners.
```

## Segments

Segments are pre-defined groups of filters.

The segment declaration involves the following properties:

| **Property** | **Description**                                                                                | **Possible Value** |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| `name`       | Specify the name of the dimension.                                                             | NA                 |
| `public`     | Controls visibility of dimension, i.e. whether the dimension is visible to all users or hidden | `True`, `False`    |
| `sql`        | Add filter criteria: `table.`{dimension}` = “dimension_values”`                                | NA                 |
| `meta`       | Custom metadata. This is also used to define `secure` sub property                             | NA                 |

In the below example, we define a filter for active owners. Similarly, we can create a filter for non-active owners to differentiate.

```yaml
tables:
  - name: owners
    # ...

    segments:
      - name: active_owners
        sql: "{TABLE}.status = 'active'"
```

Since the `segments` attribute type is an array, you can apply as many segments as required.

```yaml
segments:
  - name: sanfrancisco_sales
    sql: "{TABLE}.city = 'San Francisco'"

  - name: losangeles_sales
    sql: "{TABLE}.city = 'Los Angeles'"

  - name: chicago_sales
    sql: "{TABLE}.city = 'Chicago'"

 #....
```

## Views

Views sit on top of the data graph of lens and create a abstraction of whole data model with which data consumers can interact. They serve as a layer for defining metrics, providing a simplified interface for end-users to interact objectively with key metrics instead of the entire data model. A view reference serves as a way to access dimensions, measures, and segments from multiple logical tables. It does not define any measures, dimensions, or segments on its own.

In the example below, we create the `transaction_analysis` view which includes select members from transactions, and products tables:

```yaml
views:
  - name: owner_contact_analysis
    description: View containing detailed information about owners and their associated contacts
    public: true

    tables:
      - join_path: owners
        prefix: true
        includes:
          - owner_id
          - owner_name
          - owner_status
          - owner_value
          - owner_city

      - join_path: contacts
        prefix: true
        includes:
          - contact_id
          - contact_name
          - contact_email
          - contact_phone
          - contact_owner_id
```
