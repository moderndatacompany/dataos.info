## Can't find join path

This error occurs when a query includes members from Lens that cannot be joined to form a valid query to the upstream data source.

It is recommended to verify that all necessary joins are defined and that they have the correct directions.

For those building custom data applications, utilizing the meta endpoint of the REST API can assist in selecting members that can be joined together.

## Can't parse timestamp

This error indicates that the data source was unable to interpret the value of a time dimension as a valid timestamp. Reviewing the format of the time dimension and ensuring it matches the expected timestamp format can resolve this issue.

## The primary key is required when join is defined

This error suggests that a Lens with joins has been defined without specifying a primary key. To resolve this, ensure that a primary key is set for any Lens that includes joins.

When generating SQL queries, Lens uses primary keys to avoid fanouts. A fanout happens when two tables are joined and a single value gets duplicated in the result, meaning that some values can be double-counted.

Please define a primary key dimension in this cube to make the joins work correctly.

If your data doesn't have a natural primary key, e.g., `id`, you can define a composite primary key by concatenating most or all of the columns in the table, e.g.:

```
table:
  - name: composite_key
    sql: CONCAT(column_a, '-', column_b, '-', column_c)
    type: string
    primary_key: true
    public:true
  
```
