description: "Metis UI is a collaborative interface designed for diverse data users to efficiently navigate the data ecosystem within an enterprise. It enables users to search, discover, understand, and trust Data Products, data assets (such as tables, pipelines, and dashboards), and DataOS Resources (such as Workflow, Service, and Lens).  As soon as Lens Resource gets deployed on DataOS the Metis updates Lens related metadata in the Metis UI and stores it in the MetisDB."
