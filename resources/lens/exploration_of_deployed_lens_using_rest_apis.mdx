title: "REST API"
---

REST API enables Lens to deliver data over the HTTP protocol. It is enabled by default and secured using [API scopes](/resources/lens/api_endpoints_and_scopes/). It consists of a base path and API scopes:

* **Base Path:** All REST API endpoints are prefixed with `/lens2/api`. For example, `/v2/meta` is accessed at `/lens2/api/<lens_name>/v2/meta`.

* **API Scopes:** Endpoints are secured by API scopes, restricting access based on user permissions.

**API Endpoint Request Methods and Body Types**

When accessing different API endpoints, the request method and the format of the request body vary. Below is a breakdown of how to interact with each endpoint.

| **Endpoint** | **Method** | **Request Body Type** |
| ------------ | ---------- | --------------------- |
| `meta`       | GET        | N/A                   |
| `graphql`    | POST       | GraphQL query         |
| `load`       | POST       | Raw or JSON           |
| `sql`        | POST       | Raw or JSON           |

## Authentication and Authorization

To securely interact with the Lens REST API, you must authenticate your requests using a DataOS API key and ensure proper user group configurations. This section explains how to generate an API key and configure user groups to accessing the API.

### **Generating a DataOS API Key**

To authenticate API requests, you need a DataOS API key. This key validates your identity and ensures that only authorized users can access and query the data.

**Steps to generate an API key:**

Open your terminal and run the following command to create a new API key:

```bash
dataos-ctl user apikey create
```

To view existing API keys, use:

```bash
dataos-ctl user apikey get
```

Note down your API key and keep it secure. Use this key to authenticate API requests.

API key tokens can also be fetched from the DataOS GUI, for more details refer to the [documentation here](/interfaces/#create-tokens).

### **Configuring user groups**

To access and query data via the RESTAPI endpoint, users must be part of a user group with the required permissions. The necessary permissions are defined using the `api_scopes` attribute within the user group configuration located in the Lens directory. To know more about user groups and data policy click [here](/resources/lens/working_with_user_groups_and_data_policies/)

**Example user group configuration**

The following YAML configuration demonstrates how to set up Lens user groups with different access levels:

```yaml
user_groups:
  # User group with full access to GRAPHQL API and data querying capabilities
  - name: engineer
    description: Data Analyst
    api_scopes:
      - meta      # For accessing metadata
      - graphql   # For accessing the GraphQL API
      - data      # For querying the data
    includes:
      - users:id:exampleuser

  # User group with access to GRAPHQL API but no data querying capabilities
  - name: analyst
    description: Data Engineer
    api_scopes:
      - meta
      - graphql
    includes:
      - users:id:testuser

  # User group without access to GRAPHQL API or data querying capabilities
  - name: testuser
    description: Data Engineer
    api_scopes:
      - meta
    includes:
      - users:id:testuser
```

**Explanation of the configuration:**

* **`engineer` group:** This group can access the REST API and query data because it includes both the `graphql` and `data` `api_scopes`.

* **`analyst` group:** This group can access the REST API but cannot query the data because the `data` scope is missing.

* **`testuser` group:** This group cannot access the REST API or query data because both the `graphql` and `data` scopes are missing.

<Info>
  The user groups configured above only manage access permissions at the consumption level within DataOS. However, source-level permissions set by the source administrator (e.g., in Snowflake or BigQuery) still apply. For sources accessible through the DataOS Query Engine (Minerva/Themis), you can define source-level permissions using the [Bifrost](/interfaces/bifrost/) application in the DataOS GUI or using the [Policy](/resources/policy/) and [Grant](/resources/grant/) Resource using DataOS CLI.

## How to access the RESTAPIs?

Explore lens using REST APIs using the following methods:

1. [**Postman**](#postman): A API Testing tool for data application developers

2. [**Curl**](#using-curl): A command-line tool for transferring data with URLs, useful for automated scripts.

3. [**Python**](#using-python): Use Python's `requests` library for more complex interactions with the API.

### **Postman**

Use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to interact with Lens via REST APIs. Start by importing the following Postman collection.

[Lens-API Postman Collection](/resources/lens/lens_model_folder_setup/Lens2-APIs.postman_collection.json)

When working with a Postman collection to test APIs, you typically need to configure authorization, set request methods, and provide the request body. Below are the steps to get started:\*\*\*\*&#x20;

**Open Postman and import the Postman collection:**

* Open Postman and click on the Import button located at the top-left corner.

* Import the Postman Collection file you’ve been given. For example, if you import the Lens API collection from the provided link, you will see a collection of API requests neatly organized into folders.![postman](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dataosinfo/resources/lens/exploring_deployed_lens_using_rest_apis/Untitled1.png)

**Set up Authorization (bearer token):**

1. Once the collection is imported, click on the specific API request you want to test.

2. Go to the **Authorization** tab.

3. From the **Auth Type** dropdown, select **Bearer Token**.

4. In the Token field, paste your Bearer token, which you have received from your authentication process.

5. This token grants you access to the meta and data scopes.

**Set the Request type:**

1. Select the API method you want to use (e.g., `GET`, `POST`) from the dropdown next to the API URL.

**Prepare the URL:**  Prepare the URL according to the workspace and environment where your Lens is deployed.

    ```
    https://<DATAOS_FQDN>/lens2/api/<WORKSPACE>:<NAME_OF_LENS>/v2/meta
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

1. **Replace `<DATAOS_API_KEY>` with your actual DataOS API key.** Refer to the [Generating an API Key](https://dataosinfo.mintlify.app/resources/lens/exploration_of_deployed_lens_using_rest_apis#generating-an-api-key) section for more information on obtaining an API key.

2. **Replace `<DATAOS_FQDN>` with the fully qualified domain name of your DataOS instance.** For example: `alpha-omega.dataos.app` or `happy-kangaroo.dataos.app`.

3. **Replace `<WORKSPACE>` with the workspace name associated with your Lens model.** This is typically the name of the DataOS Workspace where the Lens is deployed. For example: `public`, `sandbox`, etc.

4. **Replace `<NAME_OF_LENS>` with the name of your deployed Lens model.** This corresponds to the specific Lens model you want to query. For e.g. `sales360`.

5. **Replace `<ENDPOINT>` with the specific endpoint you wish to access.** For e.g. `meta`, `load`, `graphql`.

6. **Replace `<QUERY>` with the specific fields you want to query from schema.** Make sure to format the query string as valid JSON.

**Set the Request Body in Postman (for POST Methods):**

* If your request is a POST (e.g., for `graphql`, `load`, or `sql` endpoints), you will need to configure the **Body** tab in Postman according to the endpoints.

            <MEASURE_1>
            <MEASURE_2>
          }
        }
      }
      ```

      ```
      query LensQuery {
        table(limit: 10, offset: 0) {
          products {
            productcategory
            average_price
            average_margin
          }
        }
      }
