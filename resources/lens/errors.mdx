# Error reference

When working with Lens, various error messages may appear in logs and API responses. This section provides a list of common errors along with guidance for resolving them.

## Can't find join path

This error occurs when a query includes members from Lens that cannot be joined to form a valid query to the upstream data source. 

It is recommended to verify that all necessary joins are defined and that they have the correct directions. 

For those building custom data applications, utilizing the meta endpoint of the REST API can assist in selecting members that can be joined together.

## Can't parse timestamp


This error indicates that the data source was unable to interpret the value of a time dimension as a valid timestamp. Reviewing the format of the time dimension and ensuring it matches the expected timestamp format can resolve this issue.


## Primary key is required when join is defined

This error suggests that a Lens with joins has been defined without specifying a primary key. To resolve this, ensure that a primary key is set for any Lens that includes joins.
