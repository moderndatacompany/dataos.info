This document provides an overview of the data sources supported by DataOS. It is designed to help users understand which data sources are supported by each component, enabling effective planning of data integration and processing workflows.

## Integration with DataOS Components

The connector support table lists various data sources and their compatibility with key DataOS components. Use this table to understand the capabilities of each component in relation to specific data sources.

* ✅ **Supported:** The data source is compatible with the DataOS component.&#x20;

* ⬜ **Not Supported:** The data source is not compatible with the component.

**Table Legend**

* **Data Source:** The name of the database, data warehouse, data lake, messaging system, or other data source.

* **Type:** The category of the data source (e.g., Database, Data Warehouse, Messaging System).

* **Depot:** Indicates whether DataOS can connect to this source using the [Depot Resource](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/).

* **Minerva:** Specifies if this data source can be queried directly using [Minerva Cluster](https://dataos.info/resources/cluster/#minerva). Minerva is DataOS' high-performance, static federation engine, designed for executing queries in specific scenarios that require fail-fast architecture and faster performance. Minerva can query data from sources via two mechanisms: through Depots (for sources connected via the Depot Interface) or via catalogs (for sources where Depots cannot be created but can still be queried). For exploring Depot support for a particular source, contact our teams to discuss potential solutions.

* **Predicate Pushdown Support (Minerva):** Indicates whether Minerva can optimize queries by pushing filters and predicates directly to the data source, reducing data transfer and improving performance.

* **Themis:** Indicates whether the source can be queried using [Themis](https://dataos.info/resources/cluster/#themis), DataOS' dynamic federation engine that supports SparkSQL. Themis auto-scales per query, and user-based scaling boundaries can be defined. It is designed to complete queries reliably in failure-prone scenarios but is generally slower than Minerva, making it less suited for real-time analysis.

* **Flare:** Determines if ETL operations with this data source can be performed using [Flare Stack](https://dataos.info/resources/stacks/flare/), which is built on Apache Spark for large-scale data processing.

* **Scanner:** Indicates whether [Scanner](https://dataos.info/resources/stacks/scanner/) can extract metadata from this source. Scanner is a DataOS Stack designed for metadata extraction from various systems.
