title: "Integrating Customer Data from Finance Service to FS Accelerator Data Product Using Depot in DataOS"
---

## **Scenario**

A financial services company aims to leverage its customer data for credit card cross-selling. The company has a customer overview dataset stored in its finance service system (MSSQL), and it needs to integrate this data into the FS Accelerator Data Product within the DataOS ecosystem. A Data Product developer is responsible for setting up the data connection.

## **Steps for Integration**

1. **Create an Instance Secret**
   &#x20;
   To create a Depot for data connection, first create an Instance Secret Resource to securely store the credentials of MSSQL.<CodeGroup>
     ```
     name: ${mssql-depot-name}-r # Unique identifier for Resource, replace ${mssql-depot-name} with depot name
     version: v1 # Manifest version
     type: instance-secret # Type of the Resource
     description: ${description} # Purpose of the Instance-secret
     layer: user # DataOS layer
     instance-secret:
       type: key-value-properties # Secret type
       acl: r # Access control: 'r' for read-only
       data:
         username: ${username} # replace with MsSQL username
         password: ${password} # replace with MsSQL password

     ```

     ```
     name: ${mssql-depot-name}-rw # Unique identifier for Resource, replace ${mssql-depot-name} with depot name
     version: v1 # Manifest version
     type: instance-secret # Type of the Resource
     description: ${description} # Purpose of the Instance-secret
     layer: user # DataOS layer
     instance-secret:
       type: key-value-properties # Secret type
       acl: rw # Access control: 'rw' for read-write
       data:
         username: ${username} # replace with MsSQL username
         password: ${password} # replace with MsSQL password
     ```
   </CodeGroup>

2. **Create a Depot manifest file**:

   * Within the Data Product pipeline (`wf-customer-overview-pipeline`), the customer overview data undergoes transformation to match the structure needed by the FS Accelerator Data Product. This ensures consistency in the data's format, particularly for customer identifiers and attributes.

3. **Apply the Depot manifest file**:

   * After transformation, the data is loaded into the FS Accelerator Data Product, where it is kept live and continuously updated. The new dataset is stored at `dataos://icebasetw:fs_accelerator/customer_overview_dp`, ready for use in any downstream applications.

4. **Validate the Depot**:

   * The FS Accelerator Data Product now contains an updated set of customer data. This information is available for consumption by other systems, such as those involved in credit card cross-selling, or any operational systems that require a consolidated and accurate view of customers.

#### **Outcome**

* The FS Accelerator Data Product now holds a unified, up-to-date set of customer identifiers and attributes. This enables the financial services company to integrate customer data from various silos seamlessly. It provides the company with the necessary data to enhance cross-selling initiatives and improve overall customer engagement and business outcomes.
