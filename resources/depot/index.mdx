Depot in DataOS is a Resource used to connect different data sources to DataOS by abstracting the complexities associated with the underlying source system (including protocols, credentials, and connection schemas). It enables users to establish connections and retrieve data from various data sources, such as file systems (e.g., AWS S3, Google GCS, Azure Blob Storage), data lake systems, database systems (e.g., Redshift, SnowflakeDB, Bigquery, Postgres), and event systems (e.g., Kafka, Pulsar) without moving the data.

Within DataOS, the hierarchical structure of a data source is represented as follows:

![Hierarchical Structure of a Data Source within DataOS](/resources/depot/udl.png "Hierarchical Structure of a Data Source within DataOS")

The Depot serves as the registration of data locations to be made accessible to DataOS. Through the Depot Service, each source system is assigned a unique address, referred to as a **Uniform Data Link (UDL)**. The UDL grants convenient access and manipulation of data within the source system, eliminating the need for repetitive credential entry. The UDL follows this format:

**`                                                                dataos://[depot]:[collection]/[dataset]`**

<Info>
  Depot Service is a DataOS Service that manages the Depot Resource. It facilitates in-depth introspection of Depots and their associated storage engines. Once a Depot is created, users can obtain comprehensive information about the datasets contained within, including details such as constraints, partition, indexing, etc.
</Info>

Leveraging the UDL enables access to datasets and seamless execution of various operations, including data transformation using various Clusters and [Policy](https://dataos.info/resources/policy/) assignments.

Once this mapping is established, Depot Service automatically generates the Uniform Data Link (UDL) that can be used throughout DataOS to access the data. As a reminder, the UDL has the format: `dataos://[depot]:[collection]/[dataset]`.

For a simple file storage system, "Collection" can be analogous to "Folder," and "Dataset" can be equated to "File." The Depot's strength lies in its capacity to establish uniformity, eliminating concerns about varying source system terminologies.

Once a Depot is created, all members of an organization gain secure access to datasets within the associated source system. The Depot not only facilitates data access but also assigns **default** [Access Policies](https://dataos.info/resources/policy/) to ensure data security. Moreover, users have the flexibility to define and utilize custom [Access Policies](https://dataos.info/resources/policy/) for the Depot and [Data Policies](https://dataos.info/resources/policy/) for specific datasets within the Depot.

<Info>
  Depot provides 'access' to data, meaning that data remains within the source system and is neither moved nor duplicated. However, DataOS offers multiple Stacks such as Flare, Benthos, etc. to perform ingestion, querying, syndication, and copying if the need arises.

## How to create a Depot?

To create a Depot in DataOS, simply compose a manifest configuration file for a Depot and apply it using the DataOS [Command Line Interface (CLI)](https://dataos.info/interfaces/cli/).

### **Structure of a Depot manifest**

To know more about the attributes of Depot manifest Configuration, refer to the link: [Attributes of Depot manifest](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/configurations/).

### **Prerequisites**

Before proceeding with Depot creation, it is essential to ensure that you possess the required authorization. To confirm your eligibility, execute the following commands in the CLI:

```bash
dataos-ctl user get
# Expected Output
INFO[0000] 😃 user get...                                
INFO[0000] 😃 user get...complete                        

      NAME     │     ID      │  TYPE  │        EMAIL         │              TAGS    
───────────────┼─────────────┼────────┼──────────────────────┼────────────────────
  IamGroot     │ iamgroot    │ person │ iamgroot@tmdc.io     │ roles:id:data-dev,  
               │             │        │                      │ roles:id:operator,  
               │             │        │                      │ roles:id:system-dev, 
               │             │        │                      │ roles:id:user,    
               │             │        │                      │ users:id:iamgroot
```

To create Depots, ensure that you possess the following tags.

* `roles:id:user`

* `roles:id:data-dev`

* `roles:id:system-dev`

<Warning>
  &#x20;If you do not possess these tags, contact the DataOS Operator or Administrator within your organization to assign you the necessary tag or the use case for the creation of the Depot.

    ### Pre-requisites specific to the ABFSS Depot

    To create an ABFSS Depot you must have the following details:

    * **azurestorageaccountname**: This is the name of the Azure Storage account where your data resides. You can find this in the Azure portal under the "Storage accounts" section. It serves as a unique identifier for your storage service.

    * **azurestorageaccountkey**: This key is used to authenticate and access your Azure Storage account. You can retrieve it from the Azure portal by navigating to "Storage accounts" > "Access keys." It is critical to store this key securely as it allows access to your data.

    * **account**: The name of the Azure Storage account. It is the same as the `azurestorageaccountname` and can be found in the Azure portal under the "Storage accounts" section. It identifies the specific storage account where your data is stored.

    * **container**: The name of the container within the Azure Storage account. A container acts like a folder or directory that holds the data. You can create and find containers in the Azure portal under your specific storage account > "Containers."

    * **relativePath**: This is the relative path to the data within the container. It specifies the exact location of the data or folder, such as "data/customer" or "files/raw\_data." You will need to specify this path based on where your data is stored inside the container.

    * **format**: This defines the format of the data stored in the Azure Storage container. Common formats include "CSV," "JSON," or "Parquet." Specify the format according to the type of data you are working with.

    ### Create a ABFSS Depot

    Azure Blob File System Secure (ABFSS) is an object storage system. Object stores are distributed storage systems designed to store and manage large amounts of unstructured data.

    DataOS enables the creation of a Depot of type 'ABFSS' to facilitate the reading of data stored in an Azure Blob Storage account. This Depot provides access to the storage account, which can consist of multiple containers. A container serves as a grouping mechanism for multiple blobs. It is recommended to define a separate Depot for each container. To create a Depot of type ‘ABFSS‘, follow the below steps:

    ### Step 1: Create an Instance Secret for securing ABFSS credentails

    <Warning>
      This step can be skipped if you prefer to create a Depot without referencing an Instance Secret.
    </Warning>

    Begin by creating Instance Secret Resource by following the [Instance Secret document](/resources/instance_secret/index#abfss).&#x20;

    ### Step 2: Create a ABFSS Depot manifest file

    Begin by creating a manifest file to hold the configuration details for your ABFSS Depot. A Depot can be created in two ways: either by directly specifying the credentials inline within the same manifest file or by creating an Instance Secret containing those credentials and referencing the Instance Secret by name in the Depot manifest file.&#x20;

    <CodeGroup>
      ```yaml Inline credentials Depot manifest file

    ### Pre-requisites specific to the Bigquery Depot

    To create a Bigquery Depot you must have the following details:

    * **projectid**: The unique identifier of the Google Cloud project where your GCS bucket resides. You can find this in the Google Cloud Console under the "Project Info" section of your project's dashboard. It is essential for associating operations with the correct project.

    * **email**: The email address associated with the Google Cloud service account. You can retrieve this by navigating to the Google Cloud Console under "IAM & Admin" > "Service Accounts" and selecting the relevant service account. This email is used for authenticating requests to GCS.

    * **json\_keyfile**: The path to the JSON key file associated with the Google Cloud service account. This file is used for authentication and can be downloaded from the Google Cloud Console under "IAM & Admin" > "Service Accounts." Select the service account, click on "Keys," and download the key by selecting "Add Key" > "JSON." Ensure the file is securely stored and the path is accessible.

    * **project**: (Optional) The name of the Google Cloud project. While not always required, it can be specified to provide additional context. You can find it in the Google Cloud Console under the "Project Info" section.

    ### Create a Bigquery Depot

    Azure Blob File System Secure (ABFSS) is an object storage system. Object stores are distributed storage systems designed to store and manage large amounts of unstructured data.

    DataOS enables the creation of a Depot of type 'Bigquery' to facilitate the reading of data stored in an Azure Blob Storage account. This Depot provides access to the storage account, which can consist of multiple containers. A container serves as a grouping mechanism for multiple blobs. It is recommended to define a separate Depot for each container. To create a Depot of type ‘ABFSS‘, follow the below steps:

    ### Step 1: Create an Instance Secret for securing Bigquery credentails

    <Warning>
      This step can be skipped if you prefer to create a Depot without referencing an Instance Secret.
    </Warning>

    Begin by creating an Instance Secret Resource by following the [Instance Secret document](/resources/instance_secret/index#abfss).&#x20;

    ### Step 2: Create a Bigquery Depot manifest file

    Begin by creating a manifest file to hold the configuration details for your Bigquery Depot. A Depot can be created in two ways: either by directly specifying the credentials inline within the same manifest file or by creating an Instance Secret containing those credentials and referencing the Instance Secret by name in the Depot manifest file.&#x20;

    Begin by creating an Instance Secret Resource by following the [Instance Secret document](/resources/instance_secret/index#abfss).&#x20;

    ### Step 2: Create a Bigquery Depot manifest file

    Begin by creating a manifest file to hold the configuration details for your Bigquery Depot. A Depot can be created in two ways: either by directly specifying the credentials inline within the same manifest file or by creating an Instance Secret containing those credentials and referencing the Instance Secret by name in the Depot manifest file.&#x20;

    <CodeGroup>
      ```yaml Inline credentials Depot manifest file

    ### Pre-requisites specific to the Bigquery Depot

    To create a Bigquery Depot you must have the following details:

    * **projectid**: The unique identifier of the Google Cloud project where your GCS bucket resides. You can find this in the Google Cloud Console under the "Project Info" section of your project's dashboard. It is essential for associating operations with the correct project.

    * **email**: The email address associated with the Google Cloud service account. You can retrieve this by navigating to the Google Cloud Console under "IAM & Admin" > "Service Accounts" and selecting the relevant service account. This email is used for authenticating requests to GCS.

    * **json\_keyfile**: The path to the JSON key file associated with the Google Cloud service account. This file is used for authentication and can be downloaded from the Google Cloud Console under "IAM & Admin" > "Service Accounts." Select the service account, click on "Keys," and download the key by selecting "Add Key" > "JSON." Ensure the file is securely stored and the path is accessible.

    * **project**: (Optional) The name of the Google Cloud project. While not always required, it can be specified to provide additional context. You can find it in the Google Cloud Console under the "Project Info" section.

    ### Create a Bigquery Depot

    Azure Blob File System Secure (ABFSS) is an object storage system. Object stores are distributed storage systems designed to store and manage large amounts of unstructured data.

    DataOS enables the creation of a Depot of type 'Bigquery' to facilitate the reading of data stored in an Azure Blob Storage account. This Depot provides access to the storage account, which can consist of multiple containers. A container serves as a grouping mechanism for multiple blobs. It is recommended to define a separate Depot for each container. To create a Depot of type ‘ABFSS‘, follow the below steps:

    ### Pre-requisites specific to the Bigquery Depot

    To create a Bigquery Depot you must have the following details:

    * **projectid**: The unique identifier of the Google Cloud project where your GCS bucket resides. You can find this in the Google Cloud Console under the "Project Info" section of your project's dashboard. It is essential for associating operations with the correct project.

    * **email**: The email address associated with the Google Cloud service account. You can retrieve this by navigating to the Google Cloud Console under "IAM & Admin" > "Service Accounts" and selecting the relevant service account. This email is used for authenticating requests to GCS.

    * **json\_keyfile**: The path to the JSON key file associated with the Google Cloud service account. This file is used for authentication and can be downloaded from the Google Cloud Console under "IAM & Admin" > "Service Accounts." Select the service account, click on "Keys," and download the key by selecting "Add Key" > "JSON." Ensure the file is securely stored and the path is accessible.

    * **project**: (Optional) The name of the Google Cloud project. While not always required, it can be specified to provide additional context. You can find it in the Google Cloud Console under the "Project Info" section.

    ### Create a Bigquery Depot

    Azure Blob File System Secure (ABFSS) is an object storage system. Object stores are distributed storage systems designed to store and manage large amounts of unstructured data.

    DataOS enables the creation of a Depot of type 'Bigquery' to facilitate the reading of data stored in an Azure Blob Storage account. This Depot provides access to the storage account, which can consist of multiple containers. A container serves as a grouping mechanism for multiple blobs. It is recommended to define a separate Depot for each container. To create a Depot of type ‘ABFSS‘, follow the below steps:

    ### Step 1: Create an Instance Secret for securing Bigquery credentails

    <Warning>
      This step can be skipped if you prefer to create a Depot without referencing an Instance Secret.
    </Warning>

    Begin by creating an Instance Secret Resource by following the [Instance Secret document](/resources/instance_secret/index#abfss).&#x20;

    ### Step 2: Create a Bigquery Depot manifest file

    Begin by creating a manifest file to hold the configuration details for your Bigquery Depot. A Depot can be created in two ways: either by directly specifying the credentials inline within the same manifest file or by creating an Instance Secret containing those credentials and referencing the Instance Secret by name in the Depot manifest file.&#x20;

    ### Pre-requisites specific to the Bigquery Depot

    To create a Bigquery Depot you must have the following details:

    * **projectid**: The unique identifier of the Google Cloud project where your GCS bucket resides. You can find this in the Google Cloud Console under the "Project Info" section of your project's dashboard. It is essential for associating operations with the correct project.

    * **email**: The email address associated with the Google Cloud service account. You can retrieve this by navigating to the Google Cloud Console under "IAM & Admin" > "Service Accounts" and selecting the relevant service account. This email is used for authenticating requests to GCS.

    * **json\_keyfile**: The path to the JSON key file associated with the Google Cloud service account. This file is used for authentication and can be downloaded from the Google Cloud Console under "IAM & Admin" > "Service Accounts." Select the service account, click on "Keys," and download the key by selecting "Add Key" > "JSON." Ensure the file is securely stored and the path is accessible.

    * **project**: (Optional) The name of the Google Cloud project. While not always required, it can be specified to provide additional context. You can find it in the Google Cloud Console under the "Project Info" section.

    ### Create a Bigquery Depot

    Azure Blob File System Secure (ABFSS) is an object storage system. Object stores are distributed storage systems designed to store and manage large amounts of unstructured data.

    DataOS enables the creation of a Depot of type 'Bigquery' to facilitate the reading of data stored in an Azure Blob Storage account. This Depot provides access to the storage account, which can consist of multiple containers. A container serves as a grouping mechanism for multiple blobs. It is recommended to define a separate Depot for each container. To create a Depot of type ‘ABFSS‘, follow the below steps:

    ### Step 1: Create an Instance Secret for securing Bigquery credentails

    <Warning>
      This step can be skipped if you prefer to create a Depot without referencing an Instance Secret.
    </Warning>

    Begin by creating an Instance Secret Resource by following the [Instance Secret document](/resources/instance_secret/index#abfss).&#x20;

    ### Step 2: Create a Bigquery Depot manifest file

    Begin by creating a manifest file to hold the configuration details for your Bigquery Depot. A Depot can be created in two ways: either by directly specifying the credentials inline within the same manifest file or by creating an Instance Secret containing those credentials and referencing the Instance Secret by name in the Depot manifest file.&#x20;

    <CodeGroup>
      ```yaml Inline credentials Depot manifest file
      name: ${{depot-name}}
      version: v1
      type: depot

          container: ${{container-name}}
          relativePath: ${{relative-path}}
          format: ${{format}}
      ```
    </CodeGroup>

    ### Step 3: Apply the Depot manifest file

    Once you have the manifest file ready in your code editor, simply copy the path of the manifest file and apply it through the DataOS CLI by pasting the path in the placeholder, using the command given below:

    <CodeGroup>
      ```bash Command
      dataos-ctl resource apply -f ${{yamlfilepath}}
      ```

      ```bash Alternative command
      dataos-ctl apply -f ${{yamlfilepath}}
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

The manifest configuration file for a Depot can be divided into four main sections: [Resource section](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/#configure-resource-section), [Depot-specific section](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/#configure-depot-specific-section), [Connection Secrets section](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/#configure-connection-secrets-section), and [Specifications section](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/#configure-spec-section%C2%B6). Each section serves a distinct purpose and contains specific attributes.

**Configure Resource section**

The Resource section of the manifest configuration file consists of attributes that are common across all resource types. For more details regarding attributes in the Resource section, refer to the link: [Attributes of Resource section.](https://dataos.info/resources/manifest_attributes/)

**Configure Depot-specific section**

The Depot-specific section of the configuration file includes key-value properties specific to the Depot-type being created. Each Depot type represents a Depot created for a particular data source. Multiple Depots can be established for the same data source, and they will be considered as a single Depot type.&#x20;

**Configure connection Secrets section**

The configuration of connection secrets is specific to each Depot type and depends on the underlying data source. The details for these connection secrets, such as credentials and authentication information, should be obtained from your enterprise or data source provider. For commonly used data sources, we have compiled the connection secrets [here.](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/depot_config_templates/) Please refer to these templates for guidance on how to configure the connection secrets for your specific data source.

🗣 The credentials you use here need to have access to the schemas in the configured database.

**Examples**

Here are examples demonstrating how the key-value properties can be defined for different Depot-types:

**Alternative approach: using Instance Secret**

[Instance Secret](https://dataos.info/resources/instance_secret/) is also a [Resource](https://dataos.info/resources/) in DataOS that allows users to securely store sensitive piece of information such as username, password, etc. Using Secrets in conjunction with [Depots](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/), [Stacks](https://dataos.info/resources/stacks/) allows for decoupling of sensitive information from Depot and Stack YAMLs. For more clarity, let’s take the example of MySQL data source to understand how you can use Instance Secret Resource for Depot creation:

* Create an Instance Secret file with the details on the connection secret:

[](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/#__codelineno-7-1)`name: $${{mysql-secret}}`
[](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/#__codelineno-7-2)`version: v1      `
[](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/#__codelineno-7-3)`type: instance-secret`
[](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/#__codelineno-7-4)`instance-secret:`
[](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/#__codelineno-7-5)`  type: key-value-properties`
[](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/#__codelineno-7-6)`  acl: rw`
[](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/#__codelineno-7-7)`  data:`
[](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/#__codelineno-7-8)`    connection-user: $${{user}}`
[](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/#__codelineno-7-9)`    connection-password: $${{password}}`

* Apply this YAML file on DataOS CLI

[](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/#__codelineno-8-1)`dataos-ctl apply -f $${{path/instance_secret.yaml}}`

For example, if a user wishes to create a MySQL Depot, they can define a Depot configuration file as follows:

YAML Configuration File

[](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/#__codelineno-9-1)[](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/#__codelineno-9-2)[](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/#__codelineno-9-3)[](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/#__codelineno-9-4)[](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/#__codelineno-9-5)[](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/#__codelineno-9-6)[](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/#__codelineno-9-7)[](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/#__codelineno-9-8)[](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/#__codelineno-9-9)[](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/#__codelineno-9-10)[](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/#__codelineno-9-11)[](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/#__codelineno-9-12)[](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/#__codelineno-9-13)[](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/#__codelineno-9-14)[](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/#__codelineno-9-15)[](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/#__codelineno-9-16)[](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/#__codelineno-9-17)[](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/#__codelineno-9-18)[](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/#__codelineno-9-19)[](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/#__codelineno-9-20)[](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/#__codelineno-9-21)[](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/#__codelineno-9-22)

To learn more about Instance Secrets as a Resource and their usage, refer to the documentation [here](https://dataos.info/resources/instance_secret/).

**Configure spec section**

The `spec` section in the manifest configuration file plays a crucial role in directing the Depot to the precise location of your data and providing it with the hierarchical structure of the data source. By defining the specification parameters, you establish a mapping between the data and the hierarchy followed within DataOS.

Let's understand this hierarchy through real-world examples:

[BigQuery](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/#bigquery_1)[Amazon S3](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/#amazon-s3)[Kafka](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/#kafka)

In the case of BigQuery, the data is structured as "Projects" containing "Datasets" that, in turn, contain "Tables". In DataOS terminology, the "Project" corresponds to the "Depot", the "Dataset" corresponds to the "Collection", and the "Table" corresponds to the "Dataset".

Consider the following structure in [BigQuery](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/depot_config_templates/google_bigquery/):

* Project name: `bigquery-public-data` (Depot)

* Dataset name: `covid19_usa` (Collection)

* Table name: `datafile_01` (Dataset)

The UDL for accessing this data would be `dataos://bigquery-public-data:covid19_usa/datafile_01`.

In the YAML example below, the necessary values are filled in to create a [BigQuery](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/depot_config_templates/google_bigquery/) Depot:

Bigquery Depot manifest Configuration

[](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/#__codelineno-10-1)[](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/#__codelineno-10-2)[](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/#__codelineno-10-3)[](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/#__codelineno-10-4)[](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/#__codelineno-10-5)[](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/#__codelineno-10-6)[](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/#__codelineno-10-7)[](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/#__codelineno-10-8)[](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/#__codelineno-10-9)[](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/#__codelineno-10-10)[](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/#__codelineno-10-11)[](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/#__codelineno-10-12)

In this example, the Depot is named "covidbq" and references the project "bigquery-public-data" within Google Cloud. As a result, all the datasets and tables within this project can be accessed using the UDL `dataos://covidbq:<collection name>/<dataset name>`.

By appropriately configuring the specifications, you ensure that the Depot is accurately linked to the data source's structure, enabling seamless access and manipulation of datasets within DataOS.

### **Apply Depot YAML**[¶](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/#apply-depot-yaml "Permanent link")

Once you have the manifest file ready in your code editor, simply copy the path of the manifest file and apply it through the DataOS CLI, using the command given below:

[](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/#__codelineno-14-1)`dataos-ctl apply -f ${{yamlfilepath}}`

## **How to manage a Depot?**[¶](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/#how-to-manage-a-depot "Permanent link")

### **Verify Depot creation**[¶](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/#verify-depot-creation "Permanent link")

To ensure that your Depot has been successfully created, you can verify it in two ways:

* Check the name of the newly created Depot in the list of Depots where you are named as the owner:

[](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/#__codelineno-15-1)`dataos-ctl get -t `depot

* Alternatively, retrieve the list of all Depots created in your organization:

[](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/#__codelineno-16-1)`dataos-ctl get -t depot `-a

You can also access the details of any created Depot through the DataOS GUI in the [Operations App](https://dataos.info/interfaces/operations/) and [Metis UI](https://dataos.info/interfaces/metis/).

### **Delete Depot**[¶](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/#delete-depot "Permanent link")

📖 **Best Practice:** As part of best practices, it is recommended to regularly delete Resources that are no longer in use. This practice offers several benefits, including saving time and reducing costs.

If you need to delete a Depot, use the following command in the DataOS CLI:

[](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/#__codelineno-17-1)`dataos-ctl delete -t depot -n ${{name of Depot}}`

By executing the above command, the specified Depot will be deleted from your DataOS environment.

## **How to utilize Depots?**[¶](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/#how-to-utilize-depots "Permanent link")

Once a Depot is created, you can leverage its Uniform Data Links (UDLs) to access data without physically moving it. The UDLs play a crucial role in various scenarios within DataOS.

### **Work with Stacks**[¶](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/#work-with-stacks "Permanent link")

Depots are compatible with different Stacks in DataOS. [Stacks](https://dataos.info/resources/stacks/) provide distinct approaches to interact with the system and enable various programming paradigms in DataOS. Several Stacks are available that can be utilized with Depots, including [Scanner](https://dataos.info/resources/stacks/scanner/) for introspecting Depots, [Flare](https://dataos.info/resources/stacks/flare/) for data ingestion, transformation, syndication, etc., [Benthos](https://dataos.info/resources/stacks/benthos/) for stream processing and [Data Toolbox](https://dataos.info/resources/stacks/data_toolbox/) for managing [Icebase](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/icebase/) DDL and DML.

[Flare](https://dataos.info/resources/stacks/flare/) and [Scanner](https://dataos.info/resources/stacks/scanner/) Stacks are supported by all Depots, while [Benthos](https://dataos.info/resources/stacks/benthos/), the stream-processing Stack, is compatible with read/write operations from streaming Depots like [Fastbase](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/fastbase/) and Kafka Depots.

The UDL references are used as addresses for your input and output datasets within the manifest configuration file.

### **Limit data source's file format**[¶](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/#limit-data-sources-file-format "Permanent link")

Another important function that a Depot can play is to limit the file type which you can read from and write to a particular data source. In the `spec` section of manifest config file, simply mention the `format` of the files you want to allow access for.

[](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/#__codelineno-18-1)`depot:`
[](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/#__codelineno-18-2)`  type: S3`
[](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/#__codelineno-18-3)`  description: $${{description}}`
[](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/#__codelineno-18-4)`  external: true`
[](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/#__codelineno-18-5)`  spec:`
[](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/#__codelineno-18-6)`    scheme: $${{s3a}}`
[](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/#__codelineno-18-7)`    bucket: $${{bucket-name}}`
[](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/#__codelineno-18-8)`     relativePath: "raw"  `
[](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/#__codelineno-18-9)`    format: $${{format}}  # mention the file format, such as JSON`

For file based systems, if you define the format as ‘Iceberg’, you can choose the meta-store catalog between Hadoop and Hive. This is how you do it:

[](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/#__codelineno-19-1)`depot:`
[](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/#__codelineno-19-2)`  type: ABFSS`
[](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/#__codelineno-19-3)`  description: "ABFSS Iceberg Depot for sanity"`
[](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/#__codelineno-19-4)`  compute: runnable-default`
[](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/#__codelineno-19-5)`  spec:`
[](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/#__codelineno-19-6)`     account:  `
[](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/#__codelineno-19-7)`     container:  `
[](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/#__codelineno-19-8)`    relativePath:`
[](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/#__codelineno-19-9)`    format: ICEBERG`
[](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/#__codelineno-19-10)`    endpointSuffix:`
[](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/#__codelineno-19-11)`    icebergCatalogType: Hive`

If you do not mention the catalog name as Hive, it will use Hadoop as the default catalog for Iceberg format.

![Flow when Hive is chosen as the catalog type](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/depot_catalog.png)

*Flow when Hive is chosen as the catalog type*

Hive, automatically keeps the pointer updated to the latest metadata version. If you use Hadoop, you have to manually do this by running the set metadata command as described on this page: [Set Metadata](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/icebase/).

### **Scan and catalog metadata**[¶](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/#scan-and-catalog-metadata "Permanent link")

By running the [Scanner](https://dataos.info/resources/stacks/scanner/), you can scan the metadata from a source system via the Depot interface. Once the metadata is scanned, you can utilize [Metis](https://dataos.info/interfaces/metis/) to catalog and explore the metadata in a structured manner. This allows for efficient management and organization of data resources.

### **Add Depot to Cluster sources to query the data**[¶](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/#add-depot-to-cluster-sources-to-query-the-data "Permanent link")

To enable the [Minerva](https://dataos.info/resources/cluster/#minerva) Query Engine to access a specific source system, you can add the Depot to the list of sources in the [Cluster](https://dataos.info/resources/cluster/). This allows you to query the data using the DataOS [Workbench](https://dataos.info/interfaces/workbench/).

### **Create Policies upon Depots to govern the data**[¶](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/#create-policies-upon-depots-to-govern-the-data "Permanent link")

[Access](https://dataos.info/resources/#access-policy) and [Data Policies](https://dataos.info/resources/#data-policy) can be created upon Depots to govern the data. This helps in reducing data breach risks and simplifying compliance with regulatory requirements. Access Policies can restrict access to specific Depots, collections, or datasets, while Data Policies allow you to control the visibility and usage of data.

### **Building data models**[¶](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/#building-data-models "Permanent link")

You can use Lens to create Data Models on top of Depots and explore them using the [Lens App UI](https://dataos.info/interfaces/lens/).

## **Supported storage architectures in DataOS**[¶](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/#supported-storage-architectures-in-dataos "Permanent link")

DataOS Depots facilitate seamless connectivity with diverse storage systems while eliminating the need for data relocation. This resolves challenges pertaining to accessibility across heterogeneous data sources. However, the escalating intricacy of pipelines and the exponential growth of data pose potential issues, resulting in cumbersome, expensive, and unattainable storage solutions. In order to address this critical concern, DataOS introduces support for two distinct and specialized storage architectures - [Icebase](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/icebase/) Depot, the Unified Lakehouse designed for OLAP data, and [Fastbase](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/fastbase/) Depot, the Unified Streaming solution tailored for handling streaming data.

### **Icebase**[¶](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/#icebase "Permanent link")

Icebase-type Depots are designed to store data suitable for OLAP processes. It offers built-in functionalities such as [schema evolution](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/icebase/#schema-evolution), [upsert commands](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/icebase/#creating-and-getting-datasets), and [time-travel capabilities](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/icebase/#maintenance-snapshot-modelling-and-metadata-listing) for datasets. With Icebase, you can conveniently perform these actions directly through the DataOS CLI, eliminating the need for additional Stacks like [Flare](https://dataos.info/resources/stacks/flare/). Moreover, queries executed on data stored in Icebase exhibit enhanced performance. For detailed information, refer to the Icebase [page](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/icebase/).

### **Fastbase**[¶](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/#fastbase "Permanent link")

Fastbase type Depots are optimized for handling streaming data workloads. It provides features such as [creating](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/fastbase/#create-a-dataset) and [listing topics](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/fastbase/#list-topics), which can be executed effortlessly using the DataOS CLI. To explore Fastbase further, consult the [link](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/fastbase/).

## **Data integration - Supported connectors in DataOS**[¶](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/#data-integration-supported-connectors-in-dataos "Permanent link")

The catalogue of data sources accessible by one or more components within DataOS is provided on the following page: [Supported Connectors in DataOS](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/list_of_connectors/).

## **Templates of Depot for different source systems**[¶](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/#templates-of-depot-for-different-source-systems "Permanent link")

To facilitate the creation of Depots accessing commonly used data sources, we have compiled a collection of pre-defined manifest templates. These templates serve as a starting point, allowing you to quickly set up Depots for popular data sources.

To make the process of creating a Depot configuration easier, we provide a set of predefined templates for various data sources. These templates serve as a starting point for configuring your Depot based on the specific data source you are working with. Simply choose the template that corresponds to your organization's data source and follow the instructions provided to fill in the required information.

🗣️ When using these templates, you will need to populate the key-value properties in the manifest file with the appropriate values for your data source. This requires a basic understanding of your organization's data infrastructure and the necessary credentials or connection details.

You can access these templates by visiting the following tabs:

[Data
Warehouse](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/#data-warehouse)[Lakehouse or
Data Lake](https://dataos.info/resources/depot/#lakehouse-or-data-lake)[Streaming
