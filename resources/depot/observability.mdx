You can track the status of a Depot‚Äîwhether it is active or deleted‚Äîusing the Monitor Resource, DataOS CLI, and Metis UI. Additionally, you can configure Pager Resource to receive notifications if a Depot is deleted.

## Status and run-time monitoring

### How to monitor the status and runtime of a Depot using Metis UI?

Users can track the status of a Depot, whether active or deleted, along with the total count of active and deleted Depot through the Metis UI.

* Simply navigate to¬†`Resources ‚Üí Depots` to check the status of any Depot within the environment. Additionally, users can quickly find a specific Depot by searching for its name in the Metis UI search bar.

    </Frame>



* When a user clicks on a specific Depot, they can also track the aggregated status along with the runtime, which applies only to certain types of Depots.

### How to monitor the status and runtime of a Depot using DataOS CLI?

Users can check whether a  Depot is active or deleted by running the command¬†`dataos-ctl resource get -t depot -n ${{depotname}}`¬†in the DataOS CLI. The output will appear as follows:

```bash
dataos-ctl get -t depot -n systemstreams              
INFO[0000] üîç get...                                     
INFO[0000] üîç get...complete                             

      NAME      | VERSION | TYPE  | WORKSPACE | STATUS | RUNTIME |     OWNER       
----------------|---------|-------|-----------|--------|---------|-----------------
  systemstreams | v1      | depot |           | active |         | dataos-manager  
```

### How to get notified whenever the status of an Instance Secret changes?

Users can configure a Monitor Resource to define the conditions for triggering an alert. They can then set up a Pager Resource to specify the alert path and the text schema format in which the alert will be delivered. The alert path can be a webhook URL, email ID, or any other designated endpoint.

This section outlines the steps to create a Monitor Resource that triggers an incident when the state of a Depot changes from active to deleted. Make sure you have the permission to create a Monitor Resource.

**Step 1: Create a manifest file for Monitor Resource**

Begin by creating a manifest file that contains the configurations of the Monitor as shown below in template. Replace the Depot name with your actual Depot.

```yaml
# Resource meta section
name: runtime-monitor
version: v1alpha
type: monitor
tags:
  - dataos:type:resource
  - dataos:layer:user
description: Attention! instance secret is deleted
layer: user
monitor:

# Monitor-specific section
  schedule: '*/2 * * * *'
  incident:
    name: depotincident
    severity: high
    incidentType: depotincident
    
  type: report_monitor
# Report Monitor specification
  report:
    source:
      dataOsInstance:
         path: /collated/api/v1/reports/resources/status?id=depot:v2alpha:bigquery-depot
    conditions:
      - valueComparison:
          observationType: state
          valueJqFilter: '.value'
          operator: equals
          value: deleted
```

**Step 2: Validate the  DataOS instance API path**&#x20;

Before applying the Monitor Resource file, it is recommended to check the response of the API endpoint.

**Step 3: Apply the Monitor manifest file**

After validating the API endpoint, the next step is to apply the Monitor manifest file by executing the code below.

```bash
dataos-ctl resource apply -f ${{path-of-your-manifest-file}}
```

**step 4: Validate the Monitor**

Validate or check the runtime of the Monitor by executing the below command.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash Command
  dataos-ctl get runtime -t monitor -w public -n runtime-monitor1 -r 
  ```

  ```bash Expected output
  dataos-ctl get runtime -t monitor -w public -n runtime-monitor1 -r         
  INFO[0000] üîç monitor...                                 
  INFO[0000] üîç monitor...complete

  ```
</CodeGroup>

Now whenever the Monitor condition is met, it will trigger an incident.

**How to create a Pager Resource to get notified whenever a Depot gets deleted?**

Through Monitor whenever the condition is met it will trigger an incident, we will use that incident to get notified on the desired platform such as Microsoft Teams, Outlook, etc. by creating a Pager Resource. This section involves the steps to create a Pager Resource.

**Step 1: Create a manifest file for Pager**

Begin by creating a manifest file that contains the configurations of Pager as shown below in template. Replace the given values with your actual values and edit the notification template as required.

```yaml

name: instancesecrpager
version: v1alpha
type: pager
tags:
  - dataos:type:resource
  - depot-failed-pager
description: This is for sending Alerts on Microsoft Teams Channel.
workspace: public
pager:
  conditions:
    - valueJqFilter: .properties.name
      operator: equals
      value: depotincident

  output:

                    "name": "Following Depot is deleted",
                    "value": "{{ index (splitn ":" 4 .ReportContext.ResourceId) "_2" }}"
                  },
                  {
                    "name": "Failure Time:",
                    "value": "{{ .CreateTime }}"
                  },
                  {
                    "name": "Severity:",
                    "value": "{{ .Properties.severity }}"
                  },
                  {
                    "name": "Run Details:",
                    "value": "<a href=\"https://${dataos-fqdn}/operations/user-space/resources/resource-status?name={{ index (splitn ":" 4 .ReportContext.ResourceId) "_2" }}&type=depot\">Operation</a>"
                  },
                  {
                    "name": "Logs:",
                    "value": "<a href=\"https://${dataos-fqdn}/metis/resources/depot/dataos.public.{{ index (splitn ":" 4 .ReportContext.ResourceId) "_2" }}/run_history\">Metis</a>"
                  }
                ]
              },
              {
                "title": "Disclaimer",
                "text": "{{ .Monitor.Description }}"
              }
            ]
          }
```

**Step 2: Apply the manifest file of the Pager Resource**

After validating the API endpoint, the next step is to apply the Monitor manifest file by executing the code below.

```bash
dataos-ctl resource apply -f ${{path-of-your-manifest-file}}
```

**Step 3: Get Notification!**

You will get a notification on the team's channel whenever the conditions of the incident are met.

    </Frame>


**CPU Usage**

CPU metrics indicate the pod‚Äôs processing power consumption. The panel displays real-time and historical CPU usage, comparing it against requested and maximum allowed limits. This helps assess whether a pod is underutilized or nearing resource constraints.

**Memory Usage**

Memory metrics show how much RAM a pod consumes relative to its allocated quota. The data highlights trends in memory utilization, ensuring that pods have sufficient resources while avoiding unnecessary over-provisioning.

**Performance Insights**

This dashboard helps maintain system stability and efficiency by providing clear visibility into resource consumption trends.

1. **Efficient Resource Management**: The panel ensures that pods are operating within assigned CPU and memory limits.

2. **Trend Analysis**: Time series graphs visualize usage patterns, helping identify spikes, bottlenecks, or inefficiencies.

3. **Optimization & Scaling**: Monitoring usage trends enables better resource allocation and scaling decisions.
