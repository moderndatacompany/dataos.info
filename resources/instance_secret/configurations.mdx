## Configuration

### **Resource meta section**

The Instance Secret manifest comprises a Resource meta section that outlines essential metadata attributes applicable to all Resource types. Note that some attributes are optional within this section, while others are mandatory. For more information about the various attributes in the Resource meta section, refer to the [Attributes of Resource meta section](https://dataos.info/resources/manifest_attributes/).

### **Instance Secret Specific Section**

**Description:**  The Instance Secret section comprises the attribute of Instance Secret Resources.

| Data Type | Requirement | Default Value | Possible Value                   |
| --------- | ----------- | ------------- | -------------------------------- |
| mapping   | mandatory   | none          | valid instance-secret attributes |

**Example Usage:**

```yaml
instance-secret: # Instance Secret mapping (mandatory)
  type: key-value-properties # Type of Instance-secret (mandatory)
  acl: r # Access control list (mandatory)
  data: # Data section mapping (mandatory)
    username: iamgroot
    password: yourpassword
```

| string    | mandatory   | none          | cloud-kernel, key-value, key-value-properties, certificates |

**Example Usage:**

```
instance-secret:
  type: key-value # Type of Secret
```

Let's see each type of Instance Secrets one by one:

Instance secrets can be categorized into four types based on the nature of the credentials they store. When creating an instance secret resource, you can specify its type using the type field within the instance-secret section. The type of instance secret facilitates the programmatic handling of the secret data.

DataOS provides several built-in types for some common usage scenarios. These types vary in terms of the validations performed and the constraints DataOS imposes on them.

| Instance Secret Type   | Description                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `key-value`            | This type stores arbitrary user-defined data as key-value pairs within an Instance Secret, with each pair being encoded separately in base64 format.                                   |
| `key-value-properties` | This type conserves arbitrary user-defined data as an Instance Secret by transforming multiple key-value pairs into a singular key-value pair, which is then encoded in base64 format. |
| `certificates`         | This is an instance secret type used to securely store certificates, which are often necessary for secured communication in the system.                                                |

For a more detailed analysis of each type and to explore the syntax, please navigate the below tabs.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="key-value">
    This Instance Secret type is for storing simple pairs of keys and values. They are stored in Heimdall vault.

    **Syntax:**

    ```yaml
    name: ${testing}
    version: v1
    type: instance-secret
    instance-secret:
      type: key-value
      acl: r
      data:
        ${key1:value1}
        ${key2:value2}
    ```

    When you store an Instance Secret as a key-value type, the system passes the instance secret in the format they are stated, without any alterations.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="key-value-properties">
    This type is similar to key-value, but the difference lies in the way the system passes the data. In the key-value-properties type, the system passes all the key-value pairs as one single field, while in the case of the key-value type, they are passed as separate fields.

    **Syntax:**

    ```
    name: ${testing}
    version: v1
    type: instance-secret
    secret:
      type: key-value-properties
      acl: r
      data:
        ${key1:value1}
        ${key2:value2}
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="certificates">
    This type is used to store TLS certificates and keys. The most common usage scenario is Ingress resource termination, but this type is also sometimes used with other resources.

    **Syntax:**

    ```
    name: ${secret-name}
    version: v1
    type: instance-secret
    instance-secret:
      type: certificate
      acl: rw
      files:
          truststoreLocation: ${file-path}
          keystoreLocation: ${file-path}
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### **`acl`**

**Description:** access control list

| Data Type | Requirement | Default Value | Possible Value |
| --------- | ----------- | ------------- | -------------- |
| string    | mandatory   | none          | r, rw          |

**Additional Notes:** the r value stands for Read while rw stands for Read-Write

**Example Usage:**

```yaml
instance-secret:
  acl: rw # Access Control List
```

### **`data`**

**Description:** The data section comprises the confidential data that needs to be stored. They are defined in the form of key-value pairs, which vary from secret type to type.

| Data Type | Requirement | Default Value | Possible Value |
| --------- | ----------- | ------------- | -------------- |
| mapping   | mandatory   | none          | none           |

**Additional Details:** The keys of `data` section must consist of alphanumeric characters, `-`, `_`, or `.`.
**Example Usage:**

```yaml
instance-secret:
  data: 
    key1: value1 
    key2: value2
```

### **`files`**

**Description:** The file section comprises the path of the file that contains the confidential data that needs to be stored. They are defined in the form of key-value pairs, which vary from secret type to type, and interpolated within the `data` field once the manifest file has been applied.

| Data Type | Requirement | Default Value | Possible Value |
| --------- | ----------- | ------------- | -------------- |
| mapping   | mandatory   | none          | none           |

**Example Usage:**

```yaml
instance-secret:
  files: 
    key_json: value1.json
```
