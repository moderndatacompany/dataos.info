To access an Instance Secret a user must have the following tag assigned:

* `roles:id:data-dev`

                               

Alternatively,  a user must have the following use case assigned:

* `Manage All Instance-level Resources of DataOS in user layer`

<Warning>
  Note that the "data-dev" tag grants permission to manage all Resources within DataOS, whereas the "Manage All Instance-level Resources of DataOS in the user layer" use case provides specific permission to manage only instance-level Resources.
</Warning>



## How to manage read-only or read-write access?

An operator can define users' access level when creating Instance Secrets by setting different ACL levels. To grant read-only access, the operator creates an Instance Secret with `acl: r`, while for both read and write access, they create one with `acl: r` and another with `acl: rw`.
