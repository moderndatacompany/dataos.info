<Tip>
  Keep in mind that the name and permission level of each tag and use case can vary across organizations, depending on how they choose to manage them.
</Tip>

To create an Instance Secret a user must have the following tags assigned:

```bash
roles:id:data-dev                             
```

Alternatively,  a user must have the following use case assigned:

```bash
Manage All Instance-level Resources of DataOS in user layer
```

<Warning>
  Note that the "data-dev" tag grants permission to manage all Resources within DataOS, whereas the "Manage All Instance-level Resources of DataOS in the user layer" use case provides specific permission to manage only instance-level Resources.
</Warning>
