An Instance Secret is a DataOS Resource designed for securely storing sensitive information at the DataOS instance level. This includes usernames, passwords, certificates, tokens, and keys. The primary purpose of an Instance Secret is to address the inherent exposure risk associated with directly embedding such confidential data within application code or manifest files (YAML configuration files).

Instance secrets establish a critical segregation between sensitive data and Resource definitions. This division minimizes inadvertent exposure during various Resource management phases, including creation, viewing, or editing. By leveraging Instance Secrets, data developers safeguard sensitive information, mitigating security vulnerabilities inherent in their data workflows.

Operators can exercise precise control over who can retrieve credentials from Secrets, if in your organization any data developer needs access to secrets you can assign them a 'read instance secret' use case using Bifrost.

<Tip>
  **Instance Secret in the Data Product Lifecycle**

  In the Data Product Lifecycle, Instance Secrets play a crucial role in securely managing credentials and sensitive information. They are particularly useful when your data product requires:

  * **Secure Credential Management**: Storing and managing sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, API keys, or certificates securely within an instance. For example, an instance secret can securely store the credentials needed to connect to a database, ensuring that these credentials are not exposed in the codebase or configuration files.

  * **Access Control**: Ensuring that only authorized components and services within the instance can access the credentials. For instance, an instance secret can be used to provide a web application with the credentials to access a third-party service without exposing those credentials to the broader environment.

  * **Auditing and Compliance**: Maintaining a secure and auditable method of handling sensitive data, complying with security policies and regulatory requirements. Instance secrets ensure that credential usage is logged and can be monitored for compliance purposes.

  By using instance secrets, you can manage sensitive information securely and efficiently, mitigating the risk of exposing credentials while enabling seamless access for your applications and services.
</Tip>

<Info>
  In the DataOS ecosystem, there are two specialized Resources designed to protect sensitive information: Instance Secret and [Secret](https://dataos.info/resources/secret/). The Instance Secret offers a wider scope, extending across the entirety of the [DataOS Instance](https://dataos.info/resources/types_of_dataos_resources/#instance-level-resources). Resources within any Workspace can utilize Instance Secrets for securely retrieving sensitive data. In contrast, Secrets are limited to the [Workspace level](https://dataos.info/resources/types_of_dataos_resources/#workspace-level-resources), accessible exclusively within a specific Workspace and only by Resources associated with that Workspace.

    ### Create an Instance Secret for securing ABFSS credentials

    Azure Blob File System Secure (ABFSS) is an object storage system. Object stores are distributed storage systems designed to store and manage large amounts of unstructured data.

    To create an Azure Blob File System Secure (ABFSS) Instance Secret in DataOS, ensure you have access to the DataOS Command Line Interface (CLI) and the required permissions. Follow the steps below to complete the creation process efficiently and securely.

    ### Step 1: Create a manifest file

    Begin by creating a manifest file to hold the configuration details for your ABFSS Instance Secret. Depending on your access needs (read-only or read-write), start with the corresponding YAML template provided below.

    <CodeGroup>
      ```yaml Read-only instance-secret
      # Azure Blob File System Secure (ABFSS) Read Instance Secret Manifest

      name: ${abfss-depot-name}-r # Name of the instance-secret, indicating it's for read-only access.
      version: v1 # Manifest Version           
      type: instance-secret # Resource-type
      description: ${description}   # Optional: Brief description of the instance-secret's purpose.
      layer: user # DataOS Layer                 
      instance-secret:
        type: key-value-properties  # Type of Instance-secret
        acl: r                     # Access control level, set to 'r' for read-only access.
        data:                       
          azureendpointsuffix: ${azure-endpoint-suffix}  # Endpoint suffix for the Azure storage account.
          azurestorageaccountkey: ${azure-storage-account-key}  # Access key for the Azure storage account.
          azurestorageaccountname: ${azure-storage-account-name}  # Name of the Azure storage account.
      ```

      ```yaml Read-write instance-secret
      # Azure Blob File System Secure (ABFSS) Read Write Instance Secret Manifest

      name: ${abfss-depot-name}-rw  # Name of the instance-secret, indicating it's for read-write access.
      version: v1 # Manifest Version           
      type: instance-secret # Resource-type
      description: ${description}   # Optional: Brief description of the instance-secret's purpose.
      layer: user # DataOS Layer                 
      instance-secret:
        type: key-value-properties  # Type of Instance-secret
        acl: rw                     # Access control level, set to 'rw' for read-write access.

    ## Create an Instance Secret for securing Snowflake credentials

    Snowflake is a data warehouse that serves as a centralized repository for structured data, enabling efficient query and analysis.

    To create a Snowflake Instance Secret in DataOS, ensure you have access to the DataOS Command Line Interface (CLI) and the required permissions. Follow the steps below to complete the creation process efficiently and securely.

    ### Step 1: Create a manifest file

    Begin by creating a manifest file to hold the configuration details for your Snowflake Instance Secret. Depending on your access needs (read-only or read-write), start with the corresponding YAML template provided below.

    <CodeGroup>
      ```yaml Read-only instance-secret
      # Snowflake Read Instance-secret Manifest

      name: ${snowflake-depot-name}-r # Unique identifier for Resource, replace ${snowflake-depot-name} with depot name
      version: v1 # Manifest version
      type: instance-secret # Type of the Resource
      description: ${description} # Purpose of the Instance-secret
      layer: user # DataOS layer
      instance-secret:
        type: key-value-properties # Secret type
        acl: r # Access control: 'r' for read-only
        data:
          username: ${username} # replace with snowflake username
          password: ${password} # replace with snowflake password

      ```

      ```yaml Read-write instance-secret
      # Snowflake Read Write Instance-secret Manifest

      name: ${snowflake-depot-name}-rw # Unique identifier for Resource, replace ${snowflake-depot-name} with depot name
      version: v1 # Manifest version
      type: instance-secret # Type of the Resource
      description: ${description} # Purpose of the Instance-secret
      layer: user # DataOS layer
      instance-secret:
        type: key-value-properties # Secret type
        acl: rw # Access control: 'rw' for read-write
        data:
          username: ${username} # replace with snowflake username
          password: ${password} # replace with snowflake password

    To create a Postgres Instance Secret in DataOS, ensure you have access to the DataOS Command Line Interface (CLI) and the required permissions. Follow the steps below to complete the creation process efficiently and securely.

    ### Step 1: Create a manifest file

    Begin by creating a manifest file to hold the configuration details for your Postgres Instance Secret. Depending on your access needs (read-only or read-write), start with the corresponding YAML template provided below.

    <CodeGroup>
      ```yaml Read-only instance-secret
      name: ${gcs-depot-name}-r  # Name of the instance-secret, indicating it's for read-only access.
      version: v1  # Version of the instance-secret.
      type: instance-secret  # Specifies that this is an instance-secret.
      description: ${description}  # Optional: Brief description of the instance-secret's purpose.
      layer: user  # DataOS layer where the secret is assigned.
      instance-secret:
        type: key-value-properties  # Type of Instance-secret, stored as key-value pairs.
        acl: r  # Access control level, set to 'r' for read-only access.
        data:
          projectid: ${project-id}  # Unique identifier of the Google Cloud project that your GCS bucket resides in.
          email: ${client-email}  # Email address associated with the Google Cloud service account.
        files:
          gcskey_json: ${path-to-gcskey-json}  # Path to the JSON key file for the Google Cloud service account.

      ```

      ```yaml Read-write instance-secret
      name: ${gcs-depot-name}-rw  # Name of the instance-secret, indicating it's for read-write access.
      version: v1  # Version of the instance-secret.
      type: instance-secret  # Specifies that this is an instance-secret.
      description: ${description}  # Optional: Brief description of the instance-secret's purpose.
      layer: user  # DataOS layer where the secret is assigned.
      instance-secret:
        type: key-value-properties  # Type of Instance-secret, stored as key-value pairs.
        acl: rw  # Access control level, set to 'rw' for read-write access.
        data:
          projectid: ${project-id}  # Unique identifier of the Google Cloud project that your GCS bucket resides in.
          email: ${client-email}  # Email address associated with the Google Cloud service account.
        files:
          gcskey_json: ${path-to-gcskey-json}  # Path to the JSON key file for the Google Cloud service account.
      ```
    </CodeGroup>

    ### **Resource meta section**

    The Instance Secret manifest includes a Resource meta section with essential metadata attributes common to all resource types. Some attributes in this section are optional, while others are mandatory. For more details, refer to the [Attributes of Resource Meta Section](https://chatgpt.com/c/678f3bec-7128-8002-ab9b-3a112795db86#).

    ### Instance-secret specific section

    This section focuses on attributes specific to Postgres Instance Secrets. It includes details like:

    * `type`: Specifies the Instance Secret type (key-value-properties).

    * `acl`: Access control level (read-only or read-write).

    * `data`: Contains sensitive information such as Azure endpoint suffix, storage account key, and storage account name.

    For more information, refer to the [Attributes of Instance-secret specific section](https://chatgpt.com/c/678f3bec-7128-8002-ab9b-3a112795db86#).

    ### Step 2: Apply the manifest

    To create the Postgres Instance Secret within DataOS, use the `apply` command. Since Instance Secrets are instance-level resources, do not specify a workspace while applying the manifest.&#x20;

    <CodeGroup>
      ```bash Command
      dataos-ctl resource apply -f ${manifest-file-path}
      ```

      ```bash Alternative command
      dataos-ctl apply -f ${manifest-file-path}
      ```

      ```bash Example usage 
      dataos-ctl resource apply -f depot_secret.yaml
      Example usage:
      $ dataos-ctl apply -f depot_secret.yaml

    To create the AWS CodeCommit Instance Secret within DataOS, use the `apply` command. Since Instance Secrets are instance-level resources, do not specify a workspace while applying the manifest.&#x20;

    <CodeGroup>
      ```bash Command
      dataos-ctl resource apply -f ${manifest-file-path}
      ```

      ```bash Alternative command
      dataos-ctl apply -f ${manifest-file-path}
      ```

      ```bash Example usage 
      dataos-ctl resource apply -f depot_secret.yaml
      Example usage:
      $ dataos-ctl apply -f depot_secret.yaml
      INFO[0000] 🛠 apply...                                   
      INFO[0000] 🔧 applying depotsecret-r:v1:instance-secret... 
      INFO[0004] 🔧 applying depotsecret-r:v1:instance-secret...created 
      INFO[0004] 🛠 apply...complete
      ```

### Validate the Instance Secret

To validate the proper creation of the ABFSS Instance Secret in DataOS, use the `get` command.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash Command
  dataos-ctl resource get -t instance-secret
  ```

  ```bash Expected output
  INFO[0000] 🔍 get...                                     
  INFO[0000] 🔍 get...complete                             

          NAME     | VERSION |      TYPE       | WORKSPACE | STATUS |  RUNTIME  |  OWNER             
  -----------------|---------|-----------------|-----------|--------|-----------|------------------------------
       depotsecret | v1      | instance-secret |           | active |           | iamgroot
  ```
</CodeGroup>

To get the list of all the Instance Secret within the Dataos environment execute the following command.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash Command
  dataos-ctl resource get -t instance-secret -a
  ```

  ```bash Expected output
  dataos-ctl resource get -t instance-secret -a
  INFO[0000] 🔍 get...                                     
  INFO[0000] 🔍 get...complete                             

               NAME            | VERSION |      TYPE       | WORKSPACE | STATUS | RUNTIME |         OWNER          
  -----------------------------|---------|-----------------|-----------|--------|---------|------------------------
    abfssv2alpha-r             | v1      | instance-secret |           | active |         | iamgroot       
    abfssv2alpha-rw            | v1      | instance-secret |           | active |         | iamgroot       
    abfsswithoutmetastore-r    | v1      | instance-secret |           | active |         | thisisthor              
    abfsswithoutmetastore-rw   | v1      | instance-secret |           | active |         | thisisthor              

  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Delete the Instance Secret

<Warning>
  Before you can delete an Instance Secret, you need to make sure there are no other Resources dependent on it. For example, if a Depot has a dependency on an Instance Secret, trying to delete that Instance Secret will cause an error. So, you'll need to remove the Depot first, and then you can delete the Instance Secret. This rule applies to not just Depot, but all dependent Resources, such as Workflow, Service, Worker, etc. The following error will be thrown if any Resource has a dependency on Instance Secret as shown below. Example usage:

  ```bash
  dataos-ctl delete -t instance-secret -n sampleinstsecret
  INFO[0000] 🗑 delete...                                  
  INFO[0000] 🗑 deleting sampleinstsecret:v1:instance-secret... 
  INFO[0001] 🗑 deleting sampleinstsecret:v1:instance-secret...error 
  WARN[0001] 🗑 delete...error                             
  ERRO[0001] Invalid Parameter - failure deleting instance resource : cannot delete resource, it is a dependency of 'depot:v2alpha:sampleinstdepot'
  ```
</Warning>

[](https://dataos.info/resources/instance_secret/first_steps/#__codelineno-15-1)

To delete the ABFSS Instance Secret, use one of the following methods:

**Method 1:**  Specify the Resource-type and Instance Secret name in the [`delete`](https://dataos.info/interfaces/cli/command_reference/#delete) command.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash Command
  dataos-ctl resource delete -t ${resource-type} -n ${resource-name}
  ```

  ```bash Alternative command
  dataos-ctl delete -t ${resource-type} -n ${resource-name}
  ```

  ```bash Example usage
  dataos-ctl resource delete -t instance-secret -n sampleinstsecret
  Expected output:
  dataos-ctl delete -t instance-secret -n sampleinstsecret
  INFO[0000] 🗑 delete...                                  
  INFO[0000] 🗑 deleting sampleinstsecret:instance-secret...deleted
  INFO[0000] 🗑 delete...complete
  ```
</CodeGroup>

**Method 2:**  Copy the Instance Secret name, version, and Resource-type from the output of the [`get`](https://dataos.info/interfaces/cli/command_reference/#get) command separated by '|' enclosed within quotes and use it as a string in the delete command.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash Command
  dataos-ctl resource delete -i ${resource-name:version:resource-type}
  ```

  ```bash Alternative command
  dataos-ctl delete -i ${resource-name:version:resource-type}
  ```

  ```bash Example usage
  dataos-ctl resource delete -i sampleinstsecret:v1:instance-secret
  Expected output:
  INFO[0000] 🗑 delete...                                  
  INFO[0000] 🗑 deleting sampleinstsecret:instance-secret...deleted
  INFO[0000] 🗑 delete...complete
  ```
</CodeGroup>

**Method 3:** Specify the path of the manifest file and use the [`delete`](https://dataos.info/interfaces/cli/command_reference/#delete) command.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash Command
  dataos-ctl resource delete -f ${manifest-file-path}
  ```

  ```bash Alternative command
  dataos-ctl delete -f ${manifest-file-path}
  ```

  ```bash Example usage
  dataos-ctl delete -f /home/desktop/connect-city/instance_secret.yaml
  Expected output:
  INFO[0000] 🗑 delete...                                  
  INFO[0000] 🗑 deleting sampleinstsecret:instance-secret...deleted
  INFO[0000] 🗑 delete...complete
  ```
</CodeGroup>
