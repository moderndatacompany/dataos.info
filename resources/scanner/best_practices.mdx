## Best Practices for Scanner Stack

### 1. Use Specific Filter Patterns

Avoid scanning unnecessary data by using precise filter patterns.

```yaml
databaseFilterPattern:
  includes: ^SNOWFLAKE.*
```

### 2. Avoid Using Wildcards at the End of Patterns

Using wildcards at the end of patterns can lead to unexpected results.

```yaml
databaseFilterPattern:
  includes: ^SNOWFLAKE$
```

### 3. Use Regular Expressions to Filter Schemas and Tables

```yaml
schemaFilterPattern:
  includes: ^TPCH.*
```

### 4. Exclude Specific Schemas and Tables

```yaml
schemaFilterPattern:
  excludes: ^TPCH_SF100$
```

### 5. Use Include and Exclude Properties with Caution

Use either `includes` **or** `excludes`, but not both together, as they are in an **OR** condition.

```yaml
# Incorrect
includes: ^SNOWFLAKE.*
excludes: ^SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA$

# Correct
includes: ^SNOWFLAKE.*
# or
excludes: ^SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA$
```

By following these best practices, user can optimize the Scanner Stack for efficiency, security, and accuracy.
