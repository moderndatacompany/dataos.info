## **How does metadata scanning work in DataOS?**

In DataOS, metadata scanning is performed using Scanner Workflows, which extract metadata from targeted data sources and systems. It is a flexible and extensible framework which can easily integrated with different sources. Users can access and query the metadata in the Metis DB to gain insights into their data assets.

## Scanner Stack

The Scanner enables the extraction of both high-level metadata such as dataset or table names, ownership details, and tags and detailed information, including table schemas, column names, and descriptions (if available in the data). Additionally, it facilitates the retrieval of metadata related to data quality, profiling, query usage, and user information associated with data assets. The Scanner Stack  also integrates with dashboard and messaging services to collect relevant metadata. For dashboards, it retrieves information about dashboards, their elements, and associated data sources.

Within the DataOS ecosystem, the Scanner Stack collects metadata from data products and DataOS Resources, which provides comprehensive insights into inputs, outputs, service-level objectives (SLOs), data access permissions, and infrastructure resources used in the creation of Data Products. It also gathers metadata from various DataOS Resources, including Workflows, Services, Clusters, and Depots, encompassing both historical runtime data and operational metrics.

The Scanner Stack is designed for **Data Engineers** and **Analytics Engineers** who are responsible for designing, building, and maintaining data products within the DataOS platform. These professionals use the Scanner Stack to extract metadata from various data sources, create data products, and ensure data quality and governance.

  **Scanner Stack in Data Product Lifecycle**

  Scanner is an essential Stack in the designing and developing of a Data Product. It plays a crucial role in the Data Product lifecycle, particularly in the **Design** and **Build** phases.

  * **Design**: Extracts metadata from external source systems to inform design decisions.

  * **Build**: Extracts metadata of related Data Products such as inputs, outputs, SLOs, policies, lineage and associated DataOS Resources to understand its functionality, performance, and reliability.

## Significance of Scanner in Data Products

The Scanner Stack plays a crucial role in the DataOS ecosystem by providing a comprehensive metadata extraction framework. It provides comprehensive insights into data products, data assets, and DataOS Resources. The metadata collected by the Scanner Stack serves three key purposes:

* **Discoverability**: The Scanner Stack helps in identifying and understanding Data Products and Resources by extracting metadata from various sources and storing it in a centralized metadata store. This metadata includes detailed information about datasets, tables, column names, descriptions, data quality, query usage, and user information associated with data assets. It also connects with Dashboard and Messaging services to extract related metadata, providing a comprehensive view of all available data assets.

* **Governance**: The Scanner Stack aids in governance by tracking data access permissions and infrastructure resources used for creating Data Products. It collects metadata about DataOS Resources such as Workflows, Services, Clusters, Depots, and more, including their historical runtime and operations data. This information helps in managing and auditing data access and resource utilization, ensuring compliance with organizational policies and regulations.

* **Observability**: The Scanner Stack enhances observability by providing metadata related to data quality and profiling. It helps monitor data quality by reactively scanning datasets and ingesting quality checks and metrics data along with their pass/fail status whenever a Flare data quality scan is initiated. The acquired metadata related to data quality is then published to the Metis DB, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of data quality.

The Scanner Stack's support for ontology and semantics can help enhance discoverability, governance, and observability by providing a clear and accurate representation of the knowledge domain, the relationships between different data assets, and the meaning of the data being managed.
