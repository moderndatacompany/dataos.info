description: "The Scanner governance can be managed through Bifrost. An Operator or administrator of an organization can control access to wo can create, read, update or delete the Scanner workflow by assigning either roles or use-cases."

The following access permissions are required to create a Scanner:

<Note>
  Keep in mind that the name and permission level of each role and use-cases can vary across organizations, depending on how they choose to manage them.
</Note>

If granting access through use-case, the following use-case is required:

1. `Manage Workflow in User Specified Workspace`

If access is granted using Role, the role that contains the Workflow-related use-case needs to be granted. For example, the Data-dev Role contains the use cases to create and manage the role.

The role Data-dev is identified as `roles:id:data-dev` tag.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Provide the name of the workspace" titleSize="h2">
    As you click on the `Manage Workflow in User Specified Workspace` a dialog box will appear prompting you to enter the name of the workspace.  Provide the workspace name to which you want to grant user access for managing the Workflow (Scanner).  &#x20;

    <Note>
      Please note that you must specify the workspace name for each action (Read, Create, Update, and Delete) to ensure precise permission assignment.
    </Note>

    For example, in the below image, the user has been granted permission to read Workflow (Scanner) in all workspace but can create update and delete only in the curriculum workspace.
     ![](/resources/scanner/governance/use_case_dialog_box.png)
     
    After filling the dialog box form, click Grant. In this way the user's grant permissions will be updated and now he will be able to read Workflow (Scanner) in all workspaces but can manage the Workflow (Scanner) in the curriculum workspace only.
