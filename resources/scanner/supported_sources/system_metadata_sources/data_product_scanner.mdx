title: "Scanner for Data Product"
---

Data product Scanner workflows is for collecting metadata related to Data products such as inputs, outputs, SLOs, policies, lineage and associated DataOS Resources.

This Scanner Workflow reads the metadata and stores it in Metis DB. This metadata helps the user to understand data product's life cycle along with the data access permissions, infrastructure resources used for creating it.

<Note>

The Scanner collects metadata for all Data Products in DataOS. Therefore, it is essential to include a filter regex under `dataProductFilterPattern`.
