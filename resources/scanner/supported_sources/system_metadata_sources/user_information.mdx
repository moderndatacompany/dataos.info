Heimdall, in DataOS, is the security engine managing user access. It ensures only authorized users can access DataOS Resources. This Scanner Workflow connects with Heimdall to scan and retrieve information about users in the DataOS environment, including their descriptions and profile images and stores it in Metis DB.

This Scanner Workflow will scan the information about the users in DataOS. This is a scheduled Workflow that connects with Heimdall on a given cadence to fetch information about users as shown below:
