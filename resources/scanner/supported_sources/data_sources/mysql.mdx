---
MySQL metadata Scanner Workflow can be configured and scheduled through the DataOS CLI. Ensure that all prerequisites are met before initiating the workflow.

## Prerequisites

- Credentials to connect to the MySQL database.
- To extract metadata, the MySQL user needs to have access to the¬†`INFORMATION_SCHEMA`.
- Metadata Scan is supported for MySQL (version 8.0.0 or greater)
- MySQL user must grant¬†`SELECT`¬†privilege to fetch the metadata of tables and views.
- Pre-created MySQL Depot. To check the Depot go to the Metis UI of the DataOS or use the following command:
    
    ```bash
    dataos-ctl get -t depot -a
    ```
    ```bash
    #expected output
    
    INFO[0000] üîç get...
    INFO[0000] üîç get...complete

    ```
    
    If the MySQL Depot is not created, create it using the following Template: 
    
    ```yaml
    name: ${{mysqldepot}}
    version: v2alpha
    type: depot
    tags:
      - ${{dropzone}}
      - ${{mysql}}
    layer: user
    depot:
      type: MYSQL
      description: ${{"MYSQL Sample Database"}}
      mysql:
        subprotocol: "mysql"
        host: ${{host}}
        port: ${{port}}
        params: # Required
          tls: ${{skip-verify}}
      external: ${{true}}
      secrets:
        - name: ${{sf-instance-secret-name}}-r
          allkeys: true
    
        - name: ${{sf-instance-secret-name}}-rw
          allkeys: true
    ```
    
- **Access Permissions in DataOS**:
    
    To execute a Scanner Workflow in DataOS, verify that at least one of the following role tags is assigned:
    
    * `roles:id:data-dev`
    
    * `roles:id:system-dev`
    
    * `roles:id:user`
    
    Use the following command to check assigned roles:
    
    ```bash
    dataos-ctl user get
    ```
    
    If any required tags are missing, contact a **DataOS Operator** or submit a **Grant Request** for role assignment.
    
    Alternatively, if access is managed through **use cases**, ensure the following use cases are assigned:
    
    * **Read Workspace**
    
    * **Run as Scanner User**
    
    * **Manage All Depot**
    
    * **Read All Dataset**
    
    * **Read All Secrets from Heimdall**
    
    To validate assigned use cases, refer to the **Bifrost Application Use Cases** section.

## Scanner Workflow for MySQL

With the use of the following sample manifest file, DataOS allows to  scan metadata from a MySQL-type Depot with the Scanner Workflows.

<Info>

Ensure that the depot is created for your MySQL database and that you have `read` access to the depot.

</Info>

```yaml
version: v1
name: mysql-scanner
type: workflow
tags:
  - mysql-scanner
description: The workflow scans schema tables and registers metadata
workflow:
  dag:
    - name: mysql-scanner
      description: The job scans schema from MySQL depot tables and registers metadata to metis2
      spec:
        tags:
          - scanner
        stack: scanner:2.0
        compute: runnable-default
                runAsUser: metis
        stackSpec:
          depot: mysqldepot
          sourceConfig:
            config:
              markDeletedTables: false
              includeTables: true
              includeViews: true
              databaseFilterPattern:
                  includes:
                      - database1
                      - database2
                  schemaFilterPattern:
                    includes:
                      - schema1
                      - schema2
                  tableFilterPattern:
                    includes:
                      - table1
                      - table2
```

The above sample manifest file is deployed using the following command:

```bash
dataos-ctl resource apply -f ${{path to the Scanner YAML}}
```

**Updating the Scanner Workflow**:

If the Depot or Scanner configurations are updated, the Scanner must be redeployed after deleting the previous instance. Use the following command to delete the existing Scanner:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash Command
  dataos-ctl delete -f ${{path-to-Scanner-YAML}}
  ```

  ```bash Alternative Command
  dataos-ctl delete -t workflow -n ${{name of Scanner}} -w ${{name of workspace}}
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
  **Best Practice:**¬†As part of best practices, it is recommended to regularly delete Resources that are no longer in use. This practice offers several benefits, including saving time and reducing costs
