description: "This section provides a guide and reference for using the MSSQL metadata Scanner Workflow. It includes configuration steps, and required access permissions for execution."
---

MSSQL metadata Scanner Workflow can be configured and scheduled through the DataOS CLI. Ensure that all prerequisites are met before initiating the workflow.

## Prerequisites

* Credentials to connect to MSSQL database.

* To extract metadata, the MSSQL user needs to have access to the¬†`INFORMATION_SCHEMA`.

* MSSQL User must grant¬†`SELECT`¬†privilege to fetch the metadata of tables and views.

* **Access Permissions in DataOS**:
    To execute a Scanner Workflow in DataOS, verify that at least one of the following role tags is assigned:
    
    * `roles:id:data-dev`
    
    * `roles:id:system-dev`
    
    * `roles:id:user`
    
    Use the following command to check assigned roles:
    
    ```bash
    dataos-ctl user get
    ```
    
    If any required tags are missing, contact a **DataOS Operator** or submit a **Grant Request** for role assignment.
    
    Alternatively, if access is managed through **use cases**, ensure the following use cases are assigned:
    
    * **Read Workspace**
    
    * **Run as Scanner User**
    
    * **Manage All Depot**
    
    * **Read All Dataset**
    
    * **Read All Secrets from Heimdall**
    
    To validate assigned use cases, refer to the **Bifrost Application Use Cases** section.

* Ensure an JDBC-type Depot is created by Resources in Metis UI or in CLI as shown below:
  ```bash
  dataos-ctl get -t depot -a
  ```
  ```bash
  #expected output

  If not, create it using the following sample manifest code:

  ```yaml
  name: ${{depot-name}}   #examples: mssqldepot, depotms, mssql01 etc.
  version: v2alpha
  type: depot
  tags:
    - ${{tag1}}
  owner: ${{owner-name}}
  layer: user
  depot:
    type: JDBC                                      
    description: ${{description}}
    external: ${{true}}
    secrets:
      - name: ${{sf-instance-secret-name}}-r
        allkeys: true

      - name: ${{sf-instance-secret-name}}-rw
        allkeys: true
    jdbc:                                           
      subprotocol: ${{subprotocol}}
      host: ${{host}}
      port: ${{port}}
      database: ${{database-name}}
      params:
        ${{"key1": "value1"}}
        ${{"key2": "value2"}}
  ```

## Scanner Workflow for MSSQL

DataOS allows to connect and scan metadata from an MSSQL-type Depot with Scanner workflows. The Depot enables access to all schemas visible to the specified user in the configured database, MSSQL.

<Info>
  Ensure that the Depot is created for your MSSQL database and you have `Read` access for the Depot.

```yaml
version: v1
name: mssql-scanner2
type: workflow
tags:
  - mssql-scanner2.0
description: The job scans schema tables and register metadata
workflow:
  dag:
    - name: scanner2-mssql
      description: The job scans schema from Mssql depot tables and register metadata to metis2
      spec:
        stack: scanner:2.0
        compute: runnable-default
        runAsUser: metis
        stackSpec:
          depot: dataos://mssql01
          sourceConfig:
            config:
              markDeletedTables: false
              includeTables: true
              includeViews: true
              databaseFilterPattern:         #use valid name and regex to filter the data
                  includes:
                      - database1
                      - database2
                    excludes:
                      - database3
                      - database4
                  schemaFilterPattern:
                    includes:
                      - schema1
                      - schema2
                    excludes:
                      - schema3
                      - schema4
                  tableFilterPattern:
                    includes:
                      - table1
                      - table2
                    excludes:
                      - table3
                      - table4
```

After the successful Workflow run, user can check the metadata of scanned Tables on Metis UI for all schemas present in the database. The above sample manifest file is deployed using the following command:

```bash
dataos-ctl resource apply -f ${{path to the Scanner YAML}}
```

**Updating the Scanner Workflow**:

If the Depot or Scanner configurations are updated, the Scanner must be redeployed after deleting the previous instance. Use the following command to delete the existing Scanner:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash Command
  dataos-ctl delete -f ${{path-to-Scanner-YAML}}
  ```

  ```bash Alternative Command
  dataos-ctl delete -t workflow -n ${{name of Scanner}} -w ${{name of workspace}}
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
  **Best Practice:**¬†As part of best practices, it is recommended to regularly delete Resources that are no longer in use. This practice offers several benefits, including saving time and reducing costs
