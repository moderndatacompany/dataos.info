title: "Scanner for Redshift"
---

The metadata from Redshift can be scan with Scanner Workflows. Here, find requirements and manifest configurations to connect to Redshift for extracting entity metadata.

## **Requirements**

To scan metadata from a Redshift data source, prerequisites are as follows:

1. Credentials to connect to Redshift database.
2. `SVV_TABLE_INFO`¬†View contains summary information for tables in the Redshift database and is visible only to superusers. The permissions to query the view is needed while scanning metadata from Scanner Workflow.
3. Redshift user must grant¬†`SELECT`privilege on table¬†[SVV_TABLE_INFO](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/r_SVV_TABLE_INFO.html)¬†to fetch the metaadata of tables and views.
4. Access to run Scanner Stack : 
    | **Access using Role Tag** | **Access using Use cases** |
    | --- | --- |
    | `roles:id:data-dev`  | Read Workspace  |
    | `roles:id:system-dev`  | Run as Scanner User  |
    | `roles:id:user`  | Manage All Depot  |
    |   | Read All Dataset  |
    |   | Read all secrets from Heimdall  |

5. Pre-created Redshift Depot. To check the Depot go to the Metis UI of the DataOS or use the following command:
    
    ```bash
    dataos-ctl get -t depot -a
    ```

    ```bash
    #expected output
    
    INFO[0000] üîç get...                                     
    INFO[0000] üîç get...complete

    ```
    
    If the Redshift Depot is not created, create a Depot using the following Depot Template give below: 
    

    ```yaml
    name: ${{redshift-depot-name}}
    version: v2alpha
    type: depot
    tags:
      - ${{redshift}}
    layer: user
    description: ${{Redshift Sample data}}
    depot:
      type: REDSHIFT
      redshift:
        host: ${{hostname}}
        subprotocol: ${{subprotocol}}
        port: ${{5439}}
        database: ${{sample-database}}
        bucket: ${{tmdc-dataos}}
        relativePath: ${{development/redshift/data_02/}}
      external: ${{true}}
      secrets:
        - name: ${{redshift-instance-secret-name}}-r
          allkeys: true
    
        - name: ${{redshift-instance-secret-name}}-rw
          allkeys: true
    ```
    

The Depot enables access to all schemas visible to the specified user in the configured database, REDSHIFT.

### **Scanner Workflow**

The manifest configuration for the Redshift are as follows: 

```yaml
version: v1
name: redshift-scanner2
type: workflow
tags:
  - redshift-scanner2.0
description: The workflow scans schema tables and register metadata
workflow:
  dag:
    - name: scanner2-redshift
      description: The job scans schema from redshift depot tables and register metadata to metis2
      spec:
        stack: scanner:2.0
        compute: runnable-default
        runAsUser: metis
        stackSpec:
          depot: demoprepredshift
          sourceConfig:
            config:
              markDeletedTables: false
              includeTables: true
              includeViews: false
              schemaFilterPattern:
                includes:
                  - ^Public$
              tableFilterPattern:
                includes:
                  - ^Customer.*
```

Once the credentials of the sample file is given by the user and save with the .yam/.yml extension it can be deployed to extract the meta data by using the following command:

```bash
dataos-ctl apply -f {full path to}/{filename}.yml
```


After the successful workflow run, user can check the metadata of scanned Tables on Metis UI for all schemas present in the database.

<Note>
  If the Depot or Scanner configurations are updated, the Scanner must be redeployed after deleting the previous instance. Use the following command to delete the existing Scanner:

  ```bash
  dataos-ctl resource delete -f {path to the Scanner YAML file}
  ```
