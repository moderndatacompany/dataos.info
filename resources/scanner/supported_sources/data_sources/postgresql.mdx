PostgreSQL metadata Scanner Workflow can be configured and scheduled through the DataOS CLI. Ensure that all prerequisites are met before initiating the workflow.

## Prerequisites
- The user should have both¬†`CONNECT`¬†and¬†`SELECT`¬†privileges on the database.
- Check weather PostgreSQL Depot is already created. To check the Depot go to the Metis UI of the DataOS or use the following command:
    
    ```bash
    dataos-ctl get -t depot -a
    ```

    ```bash
    #expected output
    
    INFO[0000] üîç get...
    INFO[0000] üîç get...complete

    ```
    
    If the PostgreSQL Depot is not created, create a Depot using the PostgreSQL Depot Template give below: 
    
    ```yaml
    name: ${{postgresdb}}
    version: v2alpha
    type: depot
    layer: user
    depot:
      type: JDBC                  
      description: ${{To write data to postgresql database}}
      external: ${{true}}
      secrets:
        - name: ${{sf-instance-secret-name}}-r
          allkeys: true
    
        - name: ${{sf-instance-secret-name}}-rw
          allkeys: true
      postgresql:                        
        subprotocol: "postgresql"
        host: ${{host}}
        port: ${{port}}
        database: ${{postgres}}
        params: #Required 
          sslmode: ${{disable}}
    ```
    
- **Access Permissions in DataOS**: 
    To execute a Scanner Workflow in DataOS, verify that at least one of the following role tags is assigned:
    
    * `roles:id:data-dev`
    
    * `roles:id:system-dev`
    
    * `roles:id:user`
    
    Use the following command to check assigned roles:
    
    ```bash
    dataos-ctl user get
    ```
    
    If any required tags are missing, contact a **DataOS Operator** or submit a **Grant Request** for role assignment.
    
    Alternatively, if access is managed through **use cases**, ensure the following use cases are assigned:
    
    * **Read Workspace**
    
    * **Run as Scanner User**
    
    * **Manage All Depot**
    
    * **Read All Dataset**
    
    * **Read All Secrets from Heimdall**
    
    To validate assigned use cases, refer to the **Bifrost Application Use Cases** section.


## Scanner Workflow for PostgreSQL

DataOS facilitates database connections via a JDBC driver for reading data from tables using Depot. Additionally, metadata can be scanned from a POSTGRES-type depot through Scanner Workflows. The Depot provides access to all schemas that are visible to the specified user within the configured PostGRES database.

<Info>

Ensure that the depot is created for your PostgreSQL database and you have `read` access for the depot.

</Info>

```yaml
version: v1
name: demopreppostgres-scanner2
type: workflow
tags:
  - demopreppostgres-scanner2.0
description: The job scans schema tables and register metadata
workflow:
  dag:
    - name: scanner2-demopreppostgres
      description: The job scans schema from demopreppostgres depot tables and register metadata to metis2
      spec:
        stack: scanner:2.0
        compute: runnable-default
        runAsUser: metis
        stackSpec:
          depot: dataos://demopreppostgres          # Postgres depot name or UDL
          # sourceConfig:
          #   config:
          #     schemaFilterPattern:
          #       includes:
          #         - Public
          #     tableFilterPattern:
          #       includes:
          #         - F_delivery
          
```

The above sample manifest file is deployed using the following command:

```bash
dataos-ctl resource apply -f ${{path to the Scanner YAML}}
```

**Updating the Scanner Workflow**:

If the Depot or Scanner configurations are updated, the Scanner must be redeployed after deleting the previous instance. Use the following command to delete the existing Scanner:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash Command
  dataos-ctl delete -f ${{path-to-Scanner-YAML}}
  ```

  ```bash Alternative Command
  dataos-ctl delete -t workflow -n ${{name of Scanner}} -w ${{name of workspace}}
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
  **Best Practice:**¬†As part of best practices, it is recommended to regularly delete Resources that are no longer in use. This practice offers several benefits, including saving time and reducing costs
