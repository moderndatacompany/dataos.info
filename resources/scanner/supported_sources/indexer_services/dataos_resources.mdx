DataOS Resources Metadata Scanner Worker is a continuous running service to read the metadata across Workflows, Services, Clusters, Depots, etc., including their historical runtime and operations data, and saves it to the Metis DB whenever a DataOS Resource is created, deleted within DataOS.

This worker operates reactively to scan specific DataOS Resource information from Poros whenever a lifecycle event is triggered. It captures relevant details and publishes them to the Metis DB, ensuring an up-to-date repository of DataOS Resources metadata.
