title: "Data quality"
---

Service Level objectives(SLOs) are business-specific validation rules applied to test and evaluate the quality of specific datasets if they are appropriate for the intended purpose. DataOS allows you to define your own assertions with a combination of tests to check the rules.

This worker is a continuous running service, designed to reactively scan datasets and ingest quality checks and metrics data along with their pass/fail status whenever a Flare data quality scan is initiated. The acquired metadata related to data quality is then published to the Metis DB, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of data quality.
