title: "Data quality"
---

Service Level objectives(SLOs) are business-specific validation rules applied to test and evaluate the quality of specific datasets if they are appropriate for the intended purpose. DataOS allows you to define your own assertions with a combination of tests to check the rules.

This worker is a continuous running service, designed to reactively scan datasets and ingest quality checks and metrics data along with their pass/fail status whenever a Flare data quality scan is initiated. The acquired metadata related to data quality is then published to the Metis DB, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of data quality.

## SODA quality checks

DataOS now also extends support to other quality check platforms, such as SQL-powered SODA. It enables you to use the Soda Checks Language (SodaCL) to turn user-defined inputs into aggregated SQL queries. With Soda, you get a far more expressive language to test the quality of your datasets. It allows for complex user-defined checks with granular control over fail and warn states.

The primary objective of this continuous running service (worker) is to reactively scan datasets, for collecting quality checks and metrics data along with their pass/fail status whenever a SODA quality scan is triggered. The collected data is saved to the Metis DB, facilitating thorough analysis and monitoring.

On Metis UI, you can view the list of SLOs created for the dataset to monitor the data quality and trend charts for each run. The trend charts also show whether the checks are passed or failed.
