title: "Data profiling"
description: "Flare Workflows are run for data profiling on the entire dataset or sample /filtered data and uses basic statistics to know about the validity of the data. This analysis is stored in Icebase."
---

A continuous running service reads about these statistics (metadata extraction related to data profiling) and stores it in Metis DB. This data helps you find your data's completeness, uniqueness, and correctness for the given dataset.

The objective of this worker is to proactively scan data profiling information, which includes descriptive statistics for datasets stored in Icebase. It operates in response to a triggered data profiling job, publishing the metadata to the Metis DB.
