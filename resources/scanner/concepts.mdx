The Scanner facilitates metadata extraction by utilizing [Depots](https://dataosinfo.mintlify.app/resources/depot/index) to connect to the metadata source.  The core concepts include:

* **Metadata Extraction**

  – Collects metadata from source systems, DataOS services, and components.

* **Scanner Job**

  – A fundamental unit of work within a

  **Workflow**

  that performs metadata extraction.

* **Source**

  – The metadata source from which the Scanner Stack extracts metadata.

* **Metadata Store**

  – Extracted metadata is stored in

  **MetisDB**

  , a centralized PostgreSQL database.

* **Scheduled Workflow**

  – Automates metadata extraction at predefined intervals.

* **Metadata Types**

  – The Scanner Stack extracts various types of metadata, including:

  * General dataset/table information (e.g., names, owners, tags)

  * Detailed metadata (e.g., table schemas, column names, descriptions)

  * Data quality and profiling information

  * User and owner details

  * Data product metadata (e.g., inputs, outputs, SLOs, policies, lineage)

## How the Scanner Stack Works

In DataOS, metadata extraction is orchestrated using two different types of DataOS resources: **Workflow** and **Worker**. The choice of orchestrator depends on the specific use case:

* **Workflow Resource**

  – Used for batch workloads that perform metadata extraction at scheduled intervals.

* **Worker Resource**

  – Used for long-running, continuous workloads that push metadata to

  **MetisDB**

  in real-time.

### Metadata Extraction Process

The Scanner Stack follows an **ETL-like process** (Extract, Transform, Load):

1. **Extract**

   * The

     **source system**

     is defined in the

     **Depot**

     , which establishes the connection to the metadata source.

   * The Scanner Stack extracts metadata from the connected source.

2. **Transform**

   * Metadata is standardized into a common format for consistency across DataOS.

3. **Load**

   * Transformed metadata is pushed to the

     **Metis REST API server**

     , which stores it in

     **MetisDB**

     (PostgreSQL).

   * **Batch-based processing**

     is handled via

     **Workflow Resource**

     , while

     **continuous ingestion**

     is performed via

     **Worker Resource**

     .

<Note>
  **Usage of Extracted Metadata**

  * Metadata is utilized by various DataOS components for

    **discoverability, governance, and observability**

    .

  * External applications running on DataOS can retrieve metadata via

    **Metis Server APIs**

    .

  * In DataOS, all metadata entities are

    **defined and consumed in JSON format**

In addition to external applications, the Scanner Stack extracts metadata from **DataOS applications and services**. The Scanner job reads relevant metadata and pushes it to **MetisDB** through the **Metis REST API server**, making it accessible via **Metis UI**.⁠

### **Scanner Job Integrations with DataOS Components**

**Collation Service**

* Scans and publishes metadata related to DataOS Resources such as Workflows, including execution history, execution states, and job metadata.

* Collects historical metadata for

  **pods, logs, and processing stacks**

  like

  **Flare**

  and

  **Benthos**

  , capturing job information and source-destination relationships.

**Gateway Service**

* Retrieves metadata related to

  **data profiling**

  (statistical summaries of datasets) from the Soda.

* Scans

  **data quality metadata**

  , capturing checks and their pass/fail status.

* Extracts

  **query usage insights**

  , identifying frequently accessed datasets and relationships between datasets.

**Heimdall**

* Scans and retrieves user information within

  **DataOS**

  , including user descriptions and profile images, accessible via

  **Metis UI**

  .

**Pulsar Service**

* Listens to messages published by various services and stacks, ensuring real-time metadata updates
