# CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW

## Synopsis

```yaml
CREATE [ OR REPLACE ] MATERIALIZED VIEW
[ IF NOT EXISTS ] view_name
[ GRACE PERIOD interval ]
[ COMMENT string ]
[ WITH properties ]
AS query
```

## Description

Create and validate the definition of a new materialized view `view_name` of a [SELECT](./select.md) `query`. You need to run the [REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW](./refresh_materialized_view.md) statement after the creation to populate the materialized view with data. This materialized view is a physical manifestation of the query results at time of refresh. The data is stored, and can be referenced by future queries.

Queries accessing materialized views are typically faster than retrieving data from a view created with the same query. Any computation, aggregation, and other operation to create the data is performed once during refresh of the materialized views, as compared to each time of accessing the view. Multiple reads of view data over time, or by multiple users, all trigger repeated processing. This is avoided for materialized views.

The optional `OR REPLACE` clause causes the materialized view to be replaced if it already exists rather than raising an error.

The optional `IF NOT EXISTS` clause causes the materialized view only to be created or replaced if it does not exist yet.

The optional `GRACE PERIOD` clause specifies how long the query materialization is used for querying. If the time elapsed since last materialized view refresh is greater than the grace period, the materialized view acts as a normal view and the materialized data is not used. If not specified, the grace period defaults to infinity. See [REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW](./refresh_materialized_view.md) for more about refreshing materialized views.

The optional `COMMENT` clause causes a `string` comment to be stored with the metadata about the materialized view. The comment is displayed with the [SHOW CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW](./show_create_materialized_view.md) statement and is available in the table `system.metadata.materialized_view_properties`.

The optional `WITH` clause is used to define properties for the materialized view creation. Separate multiple property/value pairs by commas. The connector uses the properties as input parameters for the materialized view refresh operation. The supported properties are different for each connector and detailed in the SQL support section of the specific connector’s documentation.

After successful creation, all metadata about the materialized view is available in a system table.

## Examples

Create a simple materialized view `cancelled_orders` over the `orders` table that only includes cancelled orders. Note that `orderstatus` is a numeric value that is potentially meaningless to a consumer, yet the name of the view clarifies the content:

```yaml
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW cancelled_orders
AS
    SELECT orderkey, totalprice
    FROM orders
    WHERE orderstatus = 3;
```

Create or replace a materialized view `order_totals_by_date` that summarizes `orders` across all orders from all customers:

```yaml
CREATE OR REPLACE MATERIALIZED VIEW order_totals_by_date
AS
    SELECT orderdate, sum(totalprice) AS price
    FROM orders
    GROUP BY orderdate;
```

Create a materialized view for a catalog using the Iceberg connector, with a comment and partitioning on two fields in the storage:

```yaml
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW orders_nation_mkgsegment
COMMENT 'Orders with nation and market segment data'
WITH ( partitioning = ARRAY['mktsegment', 'nationkey'] )
AS
    SELECT o.*, c.nationkey, c.mktsegment
    FROM orders AS o
    JOIN customer AS c
    ON o.custkey = c.custkey;
```

Set multiple properties:

```yaml
WITH ( format = 'ORC', partitioning = ARRAY['_date'] )
```

Show defined materialized view properties for all catalogs:

```yaml
SELECT * FROM system.metadata.materialized_view_properties;
```

Show metadata about the materialized views in all catalogs:

```yaml
SELECT * FROM system.metadata.materialized_views;
```
